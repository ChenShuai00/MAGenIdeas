However, integrating insights from my expertise in healthcare disparities, immunotherapy, and patient care, I propose a novel direction: leveraging LLM safety frameworks to address **healthcare misinformation and adversarial manipulation in patient-facing AI systems**. This idea is motivated by the growing use of LLMs in healthcare (e.g., symptom checkers, diagnostic aids) and the risks posed by adversarial inputs (e.g., manipulated prompts to generate harmful medical advice).
