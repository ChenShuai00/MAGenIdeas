The seed idea proposes a dynamic intent-aware defense framework for LLMs, which is a valuable contribution to AI safety. However, integrating insights from my expertise in healthcare disparities, immunotherapy, and patient care, I propose a novel direction: leveraging LLM safety frameworks to address **healthcare misinformation and adversarial manipulation in patient-facing AI systems**. This idea is motivated by the growing use of LLMs in healthcare (e.g., symptom checkers, diagnostic aids) and the risks posed by adversarial inputs (e.g., manipulated prompts to generate harmful medical advice). Unlike general jailbreaking, healthcare-specific attacks could have dire consequences (e.g., incorrect treatment recommendations). The proposed framework would adapt multimodal intent detection to identify and mitigate healthcare-specific adversarial inputs while preserving accessibility for vulnerable populations (e.g., non-native speakers, low-health-literacy users). This bridges AI safety and healthcare equity, a gap not addressed by existing works.

{
  "Idea": "This research proposes a **healthcare-specific adversarial defense framework for LLMs** that combines multimodal intent detection with domain-specific safeguards. The framework: (1) Uses a **clinical intent classifier** trained on medical adversarial patterns (e.g., symptom exaggeration, drug-seeking prompts) and benign patient interactions, (2) Integrates **health literacy-aware adaptation** to minimize false positives for vulnerable users, and (3) Implements a **real-time reinforcement learning module** that updates safety parameters based on clinician feedback and patient outcomes. The system will be evaluated against healthcare-specific jailbreaking attacks (e.g., prompts designed to elicit unsafe treatment advice) while measuring false positives in diverse patient populations (e.g., non-English speakers, elderly users). Metrics include clinical harm reduction, health equity preservation (disparities in false positive rates), and computational efficiency. The framework will be tested on LLMs (GPT-4, Med-PaLM) deployed in simulated clinical workflows.",
  "Title": "SAFECARE: A Health-Literacy-Aware Adversarial Defense Framework for Patient-Facing LLMs",
  "Experiment": "1. **Dataset Curation**: Collect and label healthcare adversarial prompts (e.g., from red-team exercises) and real patient queries (from EHR transcripts). 2. **Model Training**: Train a multimodal classifier (text + metadata like user demographics) to distinguish adversarial vs. genuine inputs. 3. **Bias Mitigation**: Fine-tune using fairness-aware methods to reduce disparities in false positives across subgroups. 4. **Deployment Simulation**: Test the framework in a simulated patient interaction environment, measuring jailbreak success rates and false positives. 5. **Clinician Feedback Loop**: Integrate human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning with clinician reviews of flagged interactions. Ideal outcomes: >90% adversarial detection with <5% false positives and no significant disparities across demographic groups.",
  "Excitement": 8,
  "Excitement Rationale": "This idea is highly impactful because it addresses a critical gap at the intersection of AI safety and healthcare equity. Current LLM defenses are not optimized for clinical contexts, where adversarial inputs could directly harm patients. The health-literacy-aware component is novel and aligns with growing attention to algorithmic bias in medicine. If successful, this could set a new standard for deploying LLMs in healthcare.",
  "Feasibility": 6,
  "Feasibility Rationale": "The project is feasible with API access to clinical LLMs (e.g., Med-PaLM) and synthetic datasets, but curating real-world adversarial examples may require partnerships with healthcare institutions. The fairness-aware training adds complexity but is manageable with existing libraries (e.g., Fairlearn). Computational demands are moderate (fine-tuning classifiers) but achievable with limited hardware.",
  "Novelty": 7,
  "Novelty Rationale": "While LLM defense frameworks exist, none specifically target healthcare adversarial inputs or integrate health equity considerations. The closest works are general jailbreak defenses (e.g., perplexity filters) and clinical LLM evaluations, but this combines both with a fairness lens. The clinician feedback loop is also underexplored in safety literature."

The seed idea focuses on defending LLMs against jailbreaking attempts using multimodal cues and dynamic intent evaluation. While this is a valuable direction, I propose integrating insights from my research areas—particularly climate change, misinformation, and AI ethics—to create a more holistic framework. My idea extends beyond technical jailbreak detection to address the broader societal impacts of adversarial LLM interactions, such as the spread of climate misinformation or hate speech. By combining intent-aware defense with domain-specific risk assessment (e.g., climate science credibility), this framework could mitigate not just jailbreaking but also downstream harms like misinformation propagation. The novelty lies in bridging AI safety with domain-specific threats, leveraging my expertise in polar research and climate models to prioritize high-stakes contexts (e.g., falsified ice melt data).

  "Idea": "This research proposes a **Domain-Aware Dynamic Defense (DADD) framework** for LLMs that integrates intent detection with domain-specific risk prioritization to mitigate adversarial inputs (e.g., jailbreaks) and their societal consequences. Unlike existing defenses that treat all adversarial inputs equally, DADD dynamically weights threats based on their potential real-world impact (e.g., climate misinformation vs. trivial jailbreaks). The framework comprises: (1) a **multimodal intent classifier** (extending the seed idea) trained on jailbreak patterns and domain-specific adversarial tactics (e.g., climate data manipulation); (2) a **domain-risk prioritization module** that uses embeddings from climate science corpora and hate speech datasets to flag high-impact threats; and (3) a **reinforcement learning-based response modulator** that adjusts LLM outputs to debunk misinformation or suppress harmful content while preserving benign interactions. The system will be evaluated on both jailbreak success rates and downstream impact metrics (e.g., reduction in misinformation spread simulated via agent-based modeling).",

Currently we use a default "assistant" value.Scientist3: Thought: The seed idea proposes a dynamic intent-aware defense framework for LLMs, which is a valuable contribution to adversarial robustness and privacy-preserving technologies. However, I believe we can push this further by integrating **causal inference** and **explainable AI (XAI)** to not only detect jailbreaking attempts but also **understand and mitigate the root causes of adversarial persuasion**. This approach would leverage Bayesian modeling to infer causal relationships between user inputs and adversarial intent, while XAI techniques would provide interpretable explanations for the model's decisions. This integration would make the framework more transparent and trustworthy, addressing a critical gap in current adversarial defense systems. The uniqueness lies in combining causal inference with real-time adversarial defense, which has not been explored deeply in existing works.

The framework will be evaluated on its ability to reduce false positives, improve interpretability, and maintain low computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

However, it is not fully transformative (e.g., it doesn't invent a new paradigm), hence the score of 8.",
    "Feasibility": 6,
    "Feasibility Rationale": "The idea is moderately feasible. Causal modeling and XAI are well-established techniques, but integrating them into a real-time defense system requires careful optimization to avoid computational bottlenecks. Limited hardware resources may restrict the scale of experiments, but APIs (e.g., GPT-4 for explanation generation) can mitigate this. The biggest challenge is curating a high-quality causal dataset, which may require manual annotation.",
    "Novelty": 7,
    "Novelty Rationale": "The combination of causal inference and XAI for adversarial defense is novel, as most existing works focus on detection without explainability or root-cause analysis. While some papers use XAI for model interpretability (e.g., in fraud detection), applying it to LLM jailbreaking with causal attribution is underexplored. The idea is not entirely unprecedented (e.g., causal ML exists), but the specific application to LLM safety is innovative."
