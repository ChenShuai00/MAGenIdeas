  "Thought": "The seed idea focuses on defending against human-like adversarial interactions in LLMs, which is a critical area given the increasing sophistication of social engineering attacks. However, integrating insights from my research areas—such as health disparities, ethics of AI, and intergenerational caregiving—could lead to a more holistic framework. Specifically, I propose leveraging psycho-linguistic and cultural analysis not just for defense, but also to ensure LLMs can ethically and effectively support vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly or patients with chronic illnesses) who are often targets of manipulation. This bridges gaps between AI robustness and real-world societal needs.",
  "New Idea": {
    "Idea": "This paper introduces a novel framework for LLMs to detect and mitigate adversarial interactions while ethically supporting vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, chronic illness patients, or caregivers). The framework integrates: (1) multi-modal detection (text + vocal tone + behavioral cues) of manipulative intent, (2) dynamic response adaptation based on cultural, ethical, and health-specific norms, and (3) a feedback loop involving domain experts (e.g., gerontologists, oncologists) to refine responses. The framework is evaluated on adversarial prompts targeting vulnerable groups (e.g., scams disguised as healthcare advice) and measures both robustness and ethical alignment (e.g., avoiding harmful advice). This addresses gaps in AI safety (defense against manipulation) and equity (tailored support for high-risk groups).",
    "Title": "Ethical Defense: A Multi-Modal Framework for LLM Robustness and Vulnerable Population Support",
    "Experiment": {
      "Design Steps": [
        "1. Dataset Curation: Collect adversarial interactions (e.g., phishing, emotional manipulation) targeting vulnerable groups (e.g., cancer patients, elderly) across cultures and languages.",
        "2. Multi-Modal Detection: Train a model to identify manipulative intent using text (psycho-linguistic features), vocal tone (if audio is available), and behavioral cues (e.g., urgency, inconsistency).",
        "3. Ethical Mitigation: Develop response strategies that align with ethical guidelines (e.g., avoiding medical misinformation) and cultural norms (e.g., respect for elders in certain communities).",
        "4. Expert Feedback Loop: Collaborate with domain experts (e.g., palliative care specialists) to validate responses and iteratively refine the framework.",
        "5. Evaluation: Compare robustness against state-of-the-art defenses and assess ethical alignment via expert panels and user studies with vulnerable populations."
      ],
      "Ideal Outcomes": [
        "Superior detection accuracy (>90% F1-score) for manipulative intent compared to text-only baselines.",
        "Responses deemed ethically appropriate by >80% of domain experts in blinded evaluations.",
        "High user trust scores (>4/5) from vulnerable populations in simulated interactions."
      ]
    },
    "Excitement": 8,
    "Excitement Rationale": "This idea is exciting because it merges AI safety with societal impact, addressing both technical (adversarial robustness) and ethical (support for vulnerable groups) challenges. It could set a new standard for responsible AI deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and elder care. The interdisciplinary approach (AI + ethics + health disparities) is underexplored and aligns with growing demand for equitable AI systems.",
    "Feasibility": 6,
    "Feasibility Rationale": "The project is feasible but requires careful planning due to its interdisciplinary nature. Dataset curation (step 1) and expert collaboration (step 4) may be time-consuming, but APIs (e.g., for psycho-linguistic analysis) and simulated data can mitigate resource limits. The core detection/mitigation modules (steps 2-3) can be prototyped with existing NLP tools.",
    "Novelty": 8,
    "Novelty Rationale": "While adversarial defense for LLMs is not new, the focus on vulnerable populations and integration of ethical/health-specific norms is novel. Existing works rarely combine multi-modal detection with domain expert feedback, and none target equity in adversarial robustness. This fills a critical gap at the intersection of AI safety and social impact."
