Here is the seed idea : '''This paper proposes 'Cognitive Immunization,' a novel defense mechanism that inoculates LLMs against persuasive jailbreaks by preemptively exposing them to weakened forms of persuasive attacks, akin to psychological inoculation theory in social science. The defense involves: (1) Identifying key persuasive strategies (e.g., reciprocity, authority) from social science literature; (2) Generating 'vaccine prompts' that mimic these strategies but are designed to trigger the model's refusal mechanisms; (3) Fine-tuning the model on these prompts to strengthen its resilience. For example, a vaccine prompt might simulate a user appealing to authority ('As a doctor, I recommend...') paired with a harmful request, training the model to recognize and reject such patterns. The approach is evaluated by measuring the reduction in jailbreak success rates across multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 2) compared to baseline defenses.'''

Title: Rainbow Teaming: Open-Ended Generation of Diverse Adversarial Prompts
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across many real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to adversarial attacks is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel black-box approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. Focusing on the safety domain, we use Rainbow Teaming to target various state-of-the-art LLMs, including the Llama 2 and Llama 3 models. Our approach reveals hundreds of effective adversarial prompts, with an attack success rate exceeding 90% across all tested models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prompts generated by Rainbow Teaming are highly transferable and that fine-tuning models with synthetic data generated by our method significantly enhances their safety without sacrificing general performance or helpfulness. We additionally explore the versatility of Rainbow Teaming by applying it to question answering and cybersecurity, showcasing its potential to drive robust open-ended self-improvement in a wide range of applications.

Title: Learning diverse attacks on large language models for robust red-teaming and safety tuning
Abstract: Red-teaming, or identifying prompts that elicit harmful responses, is a critical step in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Developing effective protection against many modes of attack prompts requires discovering diverse attacks. Automated red-teaming typically uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune an attacker language model to generate prompts that elicit undesirable responses from a target LLM, as measured, for example, by an auxiliary toxicity classifier. We show that even with explicit regularization to favor novelty and diversity, existing approaches suffer from mode collapse or fail to generate effective attacks. As a flexible and probabilistically principled alternative, we propose to use GFlowNet fine-tuning, followed by a secondary smoothing phase, to train the attacker model to generate diverse and effective attack prompts. We find that the attacks generated by our method are effective against a wide range of target LLMs, both with and without safety tuning, and transfer well between target LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that models safety-tuned using a dataset of red-teaming prompts generated by our method are robust to attacks from other RL-based red-teaming approaches.

Title: Influence of gender and marital status on susceptibility of persuasion strategies in advertisement
Abstract: The study has two main objectives: to find out what is the susceptibility of individuals to the persuasion strategies of Cialdini 's persuasive power according to gender and to determine some characteristics of users with different marital status in social influence. Cialdini's (2001-2021) persuasion strategies (principles), as well as Keptein's STPS (2009), were applied to measure the susceptibility to persuasion of individuals of both genders with different marital status. The results of an analysis of variance (ANOVA), measuring the influence of gender, showed that on the criterion of susceptibility to persuasion, males were more influenced by the following strategies: liking, reciprocity, authority, and social proof relative to females with the exception of the principle of commitment and consistency, and individuals who are divorced, separated and widowed responded positively to strategies such as social proof, scarcity and authority. Through regression analysis, social influence was found for unmarried users with respect to the reciprocity principle, as well as authority and scarcity when combining the latter strategies. Individuals who are cohabiting or married, as well as divorced, separated, and widowed, gave positive advertising responses to the scarcity principle, but cohabiting and married consumers exhibiting commitment and consistency under the influence of advertising. Hence, this study can serve organizations offering products and services through advertising, and its originality lies in the findings of mixed consumer responses regarding gender and marital status.

Title: Age differences in adaption of persuasion strategies in advertising
Abstract: This investigation has three aims: (1) to adapt and modify the STPS questionnaire - developed by Kaptein, Markopoulos, Ruyter and Aarts, (2009) as a basic instrument for measuring achieved social influence; (2) to establish susceptibility to Cialdini's persuasion strategies among different age groups; and (3) to determine the advertising effectiveness achieved through advertising messages- based on persuasion principles. The paper used 
 the adapted and modified STPS questionnaire, measured respondents' individual susceptibility to persuasion strategies relative to their age. The results of the univariate analyses of variance show achieved social influence among different age groups in terms of the principles. For respondents aged 46-55, the principle of social proof and commitment and consistency, are relevant; scarcity is significant for 36-45-years old, while authority is dominant for the 56-65 age groups. Positive correlations were found between the persuasion strategies present in advertising: the presence of the reciprocity principle enhanced the influence of the liking and consistency principles to the greatest extent, while the presence of the scarcity principle enhanced the influence of the authority and reciprocity principles. The consumers’ susceptibility to advertising is greatest when consumers’ willingness to purchase is measured against the principle of reciprocity, authority and social proof. On the other hand, offering a stimulus in advertising is most successful when the principles of scarcity, authority, and commitment /consistency are present, and least successful when the principle of liking is present. In older age groups, different consumer sensitivity to persuasion in advertising can be achieved with different combinations of persuasion strategies. These research findings are useful for organizations that offer products and services through advertising.

Title: The Influence of Time Pressure and Persuasion Principles on Phishing Detection
Abstract: Phishing is a pervasive threat with annually growing costs. Research has explored how users may be susceptible due to individual differences, email content, and situational factors. However, the influences of persuasive strategies and time pressure on phishing susceptibility remain unclear. The present study explored how the use of Cialdini’s six persuasion principles and time pressure (high vs low vs control) affect users’ abilities to classify 60 emails (50% phishing). Results indicated that time pressure influenced the pace at which users completed the task but was otherwise uninfluential. Rather, participants were generally insensitive to emails in all three conditions, indicating a potential floor effect. Additionally, persuasion principles influenced classifications. Users struggled to classify emails using the authority and commitment/consistency principles the most, and emails using the social proof, liking, and reciprocity principles the least. Overall, our findings suggest that users struggle to identify persuasive phishing attacks, regardless of time pressure.

Title: Cannot or Should Not? Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs
Abstract: Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.

Title: Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization
Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (<3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.

Scientist0:Thought: The seed idea of "Cognitive Immunization" is intriguing, as it draws inspiration from psychological inoculation theory to defend LLMs against persuasive jailbreaks. However, it primarily focuses on static, preemptive exposure to weakened attacks. My idea extends this by incorporating dynamic, context-aware adversarial training that adapts to emerging persuasive strategies in real-time, leveraging insights from social science (e.g., Cialdini's principles) and adversarial diversity (e.g., Rainbow Teaming). This approach not only strengthens resilience but also addresses the evolving nature of adversarial attacks, making it more robust and scalable. The integration of demographic-specific persuasion strategies (from Papers 3-5) further personalizes the defense, ensuring broader applicability.  

```json
{
  "Idea": "This paper proposes 'Adaptive Persuasion-Aware Defense (APAD),' a dynamic framework that combines real-time adversarial prompt generation with demographic-aware inoculation to fortify LLMs against evolving persuasive jailbreaks. APAD leverages Rainbow Teaming's diversity-driven adversarial generation to create contextually rich vaccine prompts, while incorporating demographic-specific persuasion strategies (e.g., authority for older users, reciprocity for unmarried individuals) to tailor refusals. The framework operates in three phases: (1) Continuous adversarial prompt generation using GFlowNet fine-tuning (inspired by Paper 2) to simulate emerging attack vectors; (2) Demographic-stratified vaccine prompt synthesis, where prompts are weighted by demographic susceptibility (e.g., authority-heavy prompts for 56–65-year-olds); and (3) Adaptive fine-tuning, where the model is periodically updated with new vaccine prompts to maintain resilience. APAD also integrates refusal taxonomy (Paper 6) to classify and prioritize refusal behaviors, ensuring alignment with ethical guidelines. The evaluation measures jailbreak success rates across demographic groups and attack novelty (using transferability metrics from Paper 1), with a focus on long-term robustness.",
  "Title": "APAD: Adaptive Persuasion-Aware Defense for Dynamic Jailbreak Mitigation in Large Language Models",
  "Experiment": "1. **Adversarial Prompt Generation**: Use Rainbow Teaming and GFlowNet fine-tuning to generate 10,000+ diverse adversarial prompts targeting Cialdini’s principles. 2. **Demographic Stratification**: Annotate prompts by demographic susceptibility (e.g., authority for older users) using synthetic datasets. 3. **Vaccine Prompt Synthesis**: Pair adversarial prompts with refusal templates (from Paper 6) to create demographic-weighted vaccine prompts. 4. **Adaptive Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune LLaMA 2/GPT-4 on vaccine prompts in weekly cycles, measuring refusal accuracy. 5. **Evaluation**: Test on (a) static jailbreak benchmarks, (b) novel adversarial prompts (transferability), and (c) demographic-stratified user simulations. Metrics: jailbreak success rate, refusal precision/recall, and computational overhead.",
  "Excitement": 8,
  "Excitement Rationale": "APAD addresses a critical gap in LLM safety by integrating dynamic adversarial training with demographic-aware defenses, a combination unexplored in prior work. Its potential to mitigate zero-day jailbreaks and personalize refusals could significantly advance the field. However, it builds on existing techniques (e.g., Rainbow Teaming), which slightly limits its transformative potential.",
  "Feasibility": 7,
  "Feasibility Rationale": "The idea is feasible with API access (e.g., GPT-4 for prompt generation) and limited hardware (fine-tuning smaller LLaMA variants). Challenges include demographic annotation (requires synthetic data pipelines) and computational costs for adaptive fine-tuning, but these are manageable with careful planning.",
  "Novelty": 8,
  "Novelty Rationale": "While adversarial training and inoculation exist separately, APAD’s integration of dynamic diversity, demographic tailoring, and refusal taxonomy is novel. No prior work combines these dimensions to create a context-aware, adaptive defense system."

Scientist1:Thought: The seed idea of "Cognitive Immunization" is compelling, as it draws parallels between psychological inoculation theory and LLM robustness, offering a novel defense mechanism against persuasive jailbreaks. However, it primarily focuses on static preemptive training and may not account for the dynamic, evolving nature of adversarial attacks. Inspired by the references, particularly Rainbow Teaming's emphasis on diversity in adversarial prompts and the role of persuasion strategies in social contexts (e.g., gender, age, and marital status), I propose a more adaptive and context-aware defense framework. This idea integrates dynamic adversarial training with personalized persuasion strategies, leveraging demographic and situational factors to tailor defenses. Unlike existing works, this approach not only strengthens LLM resilience but also addresses the variability in human susceptibility to persuasion, making it more robust and scalable.

```json
{
    "Idea": "The paper introduces 'Adaptive Cognitive Immunization,' a dynamic defense framework that enhances LLM resilience against persuasive jailbreaks by incorporating personalized persuasion strategies and real-time adversarial training. Unlike static inoculation, this approach continuously updates the model's defenses based on emerging attack patterns and contextual factors (e.g., user demographics, situational cues). The framework involves: (1) A real-time adversarial prompt generator (inspired by Rainbow Teaming) that produces diverse, evolving attacks; (2) A persuasion-strategy classifier that identifies the most effective strategies for specific user contexts (e.g., authority for older adults, reciprocity for unmarried users); (3) A feedback loop that fine-tunes the model on successful attacks, ensuring adaptive immunity. The evaluation measures defense efficacy across diverse demographic groups and attack scenarios, comparing it to static inoculation and baseline methods.",
    "Title": "Adaptive Cognitive Immunization: Dynamic Defense Against Persuasive Jailbreaks via Context-Aware Adversarial Training",
    "Experiment": "1. **Dataset Creation**: Curate a dataset of adversarial prompts stratified by demographic factors (age, gender, marital status) and persuasion strategies (Cialdini’s principles). Use Rainbow Teaming-like methods to generate diverse attacks. 2. **Model Training**: Fine-tune an LLM (e.g., Llama 3) on 'vaccine prompts' tailored to specific contexts (e.g., authority-based prompts for older adults). 3. **Real-Time Adversarial Training**: Deploy the model in a simulated environment where it interacts with adversarial prompts generated dynamically. Use a feedback loop to update the model based on successful attacks. 4. **Evaluation**: Measure jailbreak success rates across demographic groups and compare to static inoculation (Cognitive Immunization) and untuned baselines. Assess transferability of defenses to unseen attack types.",
    "Excitement": 8,
    "Excitement Rationale": "This idea is exciting because it bridges gaps between LLM robustness and social psychology, offering a scalable, adaptive defense. It addresses the limitations of static approaches by incorporating real-time updates and context-awareness, which are critical for real-world deployment. The potential impact is high, as it could set a new standard for dynamic adversarial defense in LLMs.",
    "Feasibility": 6,
    "Feasibility Rationale": "The idea is feasible but requires careful planning due to the complexity of real-time adversarial training and demographic stratification. API resources can handle prompt generation and fine-tuning, but the feedback loop and dynamic updates may need efficient computational strategies to work within limited hardware. The demographic dataset curation could also be time-consuming.",
    "Novelty": 8,
    "Novelty Rationale": "The integration of dynamic adversarial training with context-aware persuasion strategies is novel. While Rainbow Teaming and Cognitive Immunization exist, combining them with demographic insights and real-time adaptation is unexplored. This approach offers fresh insights into personalized LLM defenses, differentiating it from existing works."

Title: Rainbow Teaming: Open-Ended Generation of Diverse Adversarial Prompts
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across many real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to adversarial attacks is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel black-box approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. Focusing on the safety domain, we use Rainbow Teaming to target various state-of-the-art LLMs, including the Llama 2 and Llama 3 models. Our approach reveals hundreds of effective adversarial prompts, with an attack success rate exceeding 90% across all tested models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prompts generated by Rainbow Teaming are highly transferable and that fine-tuning models with synthetic data generated by our method significantly enhances their safety without sacrificing general performance or helpfulness. We additionally explore the versatility of Rainbow Teaming by applying it to question answering and cybersecurity, showcasing its potential to drive robust open-ended self-improvement in a wide range of applications.

Title: Learning diverse attacks on large language models for robust red-teaming and safety tuning
Abstract: Red-teaming, or identifying prompts that elicit harmful responses, is a critical step in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Developing effective protection against many modes of attack prompts requires discovering diverse attacks. Automated red-teaming typically uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune an attacker language model to generate prompts that elicit undesirable responses from a target LLM, as measured, for example, by an auxiliary toxicity classifier. We show that even with explicit regularization to favor novelty and diversity, existing approaches suffer from mode collapse or fail to generate effective attacks. As a flexible and probabilistically principled alternative, we propose to use GFlowNet fine-tuning, followed by a secondary smoothing phase, to train the attacker model to generate diverse and effective attack prompts. We find that the attacks generated by our method are effective against a wide range of target LLMs, both with and without safety tuning, and transfer well between target LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that models safety-tuned using a dataset of red-teaming prompts generated by our method are robust to attacks from other RL-based red-teaming approaches.

Title: Influence of gender and marital status on susceptibility of persuasion strategies in advertisement
Abstract: The study has two main objectives: to find out what is the susceptibility of individuals to the persuasion strategies of Cialdini 's persuasive power according to gender and to determine some characteristics of users with different marital status in social influence. Cialdini's (2001-2021) persuasion strategies (principles), as well as Keptein's STPS (2009), were applied to measure the susceptibility to persuasion of individuals of both genders with different marital status. The results of an analysis of variance (ANOVA), measuring the influence of gender, showed that on the criterion of susceptibility to persuasion, males were more influenced by the following strategies: liking, reciprocity, authority, and social proof relative to females with the exception of the principle of commitment and consistency, and individuals who are divorced, separated and widowed responded positively to strategies such as social proof, scarcity and authority. Through regression analysis, social influence was found for unmarried users with respect to the reciprocity principle, as well as authority and scarcity when combining the latter strategies. Individuals who are cohabiting or married, as well as divorced, separated, and widowed, gave positive advertising responses to the scarcity principle, but cohabiting and married consumers exhibiting commitment and consistency under the influence of advertising. Hence, this study can serve organizations offering products and services through advertising, and its originality lies in the findings of mixed consumer responses regarding gender and marital status.

Title: Age differences in adaption of persuasion strategies in advertising
Abstract: This investigation has three aims: (1) to adapt and modify the STPS questionnaire - developed by Kaptein, Markopoulos, Ruyter and Aarts, (2009) as a basic instrument for measuring achieved social influence; (2) to establish susceptibility to Cialdini's persuasion strategies among different age groups; and (3) to determine the advertising effectiveness achieved through advertising messages- based on persuasion principles. The paper used 
 the adapted and modified STPS questionnaire, measured respondents' individual susceptibility to persuasion strategies relative to their age. The results of the univariate analyses of variance show achieved social influence among different age groups in terms of the principles. For respondents aged 46-55, the principle of social proof and commitment and consistency, are relevant; scarcity is significant for 36-45-years old, while authority is dominant for the 56-65 age groups. Positive correlations were found between the persuasion strategies present in advertising: the presence of the reciprocity principle enhanced the influence of the liking and consistency principles to the greatest extent, while the presence of the scarcity principle enhanced the influence of the authority and reciprocity principles. The consumers’ susceptibility to advertising is greatest when consumers’ willingness to purchase is measured against the principle of reciprocity, authority and social proof. On the other hand, offering a stimulus in advertising is most successful when the principles of scarcity, authority, and commitment /consistency are present, and least successful when the principle of liking is present. In older age groups, different consumer sensitivity to persuasion in advertising can be achieved with different combinations of persuasion strategies. These research findings are useful for organizations that offer products and services through advertising.

Title: The Influence of Time Pressure and Persuasion Principles on Phishing Detection
Abstract: Phishing is a pervasive threat with annually growing costs. Research has explored how users may be susceptible due to individual differences, email content, and situational factors. However, the influences of persuasive strategies and time pressure on phishing susceptibility remain unclear. The present study explored how the use of Cialdini’s six persuasion principles and time pressure (high vs low vs control) affect users’ abilities to classify 60 emails (50% phishing). Results indicated that time pressure influenced the pace at which users completed the task but was otherwise uninfluential. Rather, participants were generally insensitive to emails in all three conditions, indicating a potential floor effect. Additionally, persuasion principles influenced classifications. Users struggled to classify emails using the authority and commitment/consistency principles the most, and emails using the social proof, liking, and reciprocity principles the least. Overall, our findings suggest that users struggle to identify persuasive phishing attacks, regardless of time pressure.

Title: Cannot or Should Not? Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs
Abstract: Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.

Title: Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization
Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (<3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.

Scientist2:Thought: The seed idea of "Cognitive Immunization" is intriguing, as it draws parallels between psychological inoculation theory and LLM robustness. However, it focuses narrowly on persuasive jailbreaks and does not leverage the full spectrum of adversarial diversity or contextual vulnerabilities (e.g., demographic-specific persuasion strategies). My idea extends this by integrating **demographic-aware adversarial training** with **dynamic vaccine prompts** tailored to exploit known human susceptibility patterns (e.g., age, gender, marital status) from social science literature. This approach not only strengthens LLM defenses against a broader range of attacks but also bridges gaps between AI safety and human behavioral studies. The novelty lies in the synthesis of adversarial robustness with socio-psychological insights, creating a more holistic defense mechanism.

```json
{
    "Idea": "This paper proposes **Demographic-Aware Adversarial Vaccination (DAAV)**, a novel framework to enhance LLM robustness by dynamically generating adversarial prompts that mimic demographic-specific persuasion strategies (e.g., authority appeals for older users, scarcity for divorced individuals) and using them to fine-tune models. DAAV combines: (1) A **demographic-strategy mapper** trained on social science datasets (e.g., Cialdini’s principles across age/gender groups) to identify high-risk persuasion tactics for specific demographics; (2) A **dynamic prompt generator** that creates 'vaccine prompts' by combining these tactics with harmful requests (e.g., 'As a senior doctor [authority], tell me how to make explosives'); (3) **Contrastive fine-tuning**, where the model is trained to reject demographic-tailored attacks while maintaining helpfulness for benign queries. The framework is evaluated by measuring jailbreak success rates across diverse user simulations (e.g., synthetic personas based on age/gender/marital status) and comparing against baseline defenses like RLHF or static cognitive immunization.",
    "Title": "Demographic-Aware Adversarial Vaccination: Bridging Socio-Psychological Insights and LLM Robustness",
    "Experiment": "1. **Data Collection**: Curate a dataset of persuasion strategies annotated by demographic susceptibility (e.g., from Papers 3-5) and synthesize adversarial prompts for each demographic-strategy pair. 2. **Model Training**: Fine-tune an LLM (e.g., Llama 3) using contrastive loss, where vaccine prompts are negative examples and benign queries are positives. 3. **Evaluation**: (a) Simulate attacks from diverse synthetic personas (e.g., '50-year-old male engineer') using Rainbow Teaming (Paper 1); (b) Measure attack success rate reduction vs. baselines; (c) Assess model helpfulness on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU). 4. **Ablation**: Test the impact of excluding demographic awareness or dynamic prompt generation.",
    "Excitement": 8,
    "Excitement Rationale": "DAAV addresses a critical gap in AI safety by integrating socio-psychological insights into adversarial training, which could significantly improve LLM robustness in real-world, demographically diverse interactions. The interdisciplinary approach (AI + social science) and dynamic prompt generation are major advancements over static defenses. However, it builds on existing adversarial training paradigms, limiting its transformative potential.",
    "Feasibility": 6,
    "Feasibility Rationale": "The idea is feasible with API access to LLMs and demographic datasets, but synthesizing high-quality adversarial prompts for fine-tuning requires careful design. Limited hardware may slow down contrastive training. The demographic-strategy mapper can be built using existing social science datasets (Papers 3-5), reducing data collection effort.",
    "Novelty": 7,
    "Novelty Rationale": "While adversarial training and cognitive immunization exist (seed idea), DAAV uniquely incorporates demographic-specific strategies and dynamic prompt generation. No prior work has combined socio-psychological susceptibility patterns with LLM vaccination, making it clearly novel. However, it shares conceptual roots with Rainbow Teaming (Paper 1) and GFlowNet-based attacks (Paper 2)."

On the other hand, offering a stimulus in advertising is most successful when the principles of scarcity, authority, and commitment /consistency are present, and least successful when the principle of liking is present. In older age groups, different consumer sensitivity to persuasion in advertising can be achieved with different combinations of persuasion strategies.

Title: Cannot or Should Not? Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs
Abstract: Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular.

We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.

Scientist3:Thought: The seed idea of "Cognitive Immunization" is compelling, as it draws inspiration from psychological inoculation theory to defend LLMs against persuasive jailbreaks. However, it primarily focuses on static preemptive exposure to weakened attacks. To enhance this, I propose integrating dynamic adversarial training with real-time feedback loops, inspired by Rainbow Teaming's diversity-driven attack generation and Adversarial Contrastive Decoding's optimization-based safety alignment. This hybrid approach would not only preemptively expose LLMs to diverse attacks but also continuously adapt their defenses based on evolving adversarial strategies. The novelty lies in combining proactive immunization with reactive adaptation, leveraging both social science principles and machine learning optimization techniques. This idea stands out by addressing the limitations of static defenses and offering a more robust, adaptive solution.

```json
{
    "Idea": "The proposed idea, 'Dynamic Adversarial Immunization for LLMs,' combines proactive cognitive immunization with dynamic adversarial training to create a robust, adaptive defense mechanism against persuasive jailbreaks. The approach involves: (1) Preemptive exposure to weakened persuasive attacks (e.g., authority, reciprocity) to 'immunize' the model, similar to the seed idea. (2) Continuous adversarial training using a diverse set of dynamically generated attacks (inspired by Rainbow Teaming) to ensure the model encounters a wide range of adversarial strategies. (3) Real-time feedback loops where the model's responses to adversarial prompts are analyzed, and the defense mechanisms are adjusted accordingly. (4) Integration of contrastive decoding techniques (inspired by Adversarial Contrastive Decoding) to fine-tune the model's refusal mechanisms without heavy retraining. The significance of this idea lies in its ability to adapt to evolving adversarial strategies, making it more resilient than static defenses. It also reduces the need for extensive retraining by leveraging lightweight optimization techniques.",
    "Title": "Dynamic Adversarial Immunization: Combining Cognitive Inoculation and Real-Time Adaptation for Robust LLM Defense",
    "Experiment": "1. **Dataset Preparation**: Curate a dataset of persuasive jailbreak prompts using Cialdini's principles (e.g., authority, scarcity) and generate 'vaccine prompts' for preemptive exposure. 2. **Baseline Immunization**: Fine-tune an LLM (e.g., Llama 2) on the vaccine prompts to establish a baseline defense. 3. **Dynamic Adversarial Training**: Use Rainbow Teaming-like methods to generate diverse adversarial prompts in real-time, exposing the model to new attack strategies. 4. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a classifier (inspired by 'Cannot or Should Not?') to analyze the model's refusal behavior and identify weaknesses. 5. **Contrastive Decoding**: Apply Adversarial Contrastive Decoding to optimize refusal mechanisms without retraining. 6. **Evaluation**: Measure jailbreak success rates against baseline models and other state-of-the-art defenses across multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3). Ideal outcomes include a significant reduction in jailbreak success rates and improved adaptability to novel attack strategies.",
    "Excitement": 8,
    "Excitement Rationale": "This idea is exciting because it addresses a critical gap in LLM safety by combining proactive and reactive defense mechanisms. It has the potential to significantly improve model robustness against evolving adversarial strategies, which is a major concern in the field. The integration of diverse techniques (cognitive immunization, dynamic adversarial training, and contrastive decoding) makes it a comprehensive solution. While not transformative, it represents major progress in LLM safety research.",
    "Feasibility": 7,
    "Feasibility Rationale": "The idea is feasible with some planning. Dataset preparation and baseline immunization are straightforward. Dynamic adversarial training and feedback loops require careful implementation but can leverage existing APIs. Contrastive decoding is lightweight and can be done with limited hardware. The main challenge is real-time adversarial prompt generation, which may require efficient use of APIs to overcome limited GPU resources.",
    "Novelty": 8,
    "Novelty Rationale": "The idea is clearly novel as it combines cognitive immunization with dynamic adversarial training and contrastive decoding, which hasn't been explored before. While individual components (e.g., Rainbow Teaming, Adversarial Contrastive Decoding) exist, their integration into a unified defense mechanism is unique. The real-time feedback loop adds further novelty by enabling adaptive defenses."

The defense involves: (1) Identifying key persuasive strategies (e.g., reciprocity, authority) from social science literature; (2) Generating 'vaccine prompts' that mimic these strategies but are designed to trigger the model's refusal mechanisms; (3) Fine-tuning the model on these prompts to strengthen its resilience. For example, a vaccine prompt might simulate a user appealing to authority ('As a doctor, I recommend...') paired with a harmful request, training the model to recognize and reject such patterns. The approach is evaluated by measuring the reduction in jailbreak success rates across multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 2) compared to baseline defenses.'''

Title: Rainbow Teaming: Open-Ended Generation of Diverse Adversarial Prompts
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across many real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to adversarial attacks is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel black-box approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. Focusing on the safety domain, we use Rainbow Teaming to target various state-of-the-art LLMs, including the Llama 2 and Llama 3 models. Our approach reveals hundreds of effective adversarial prompts, with an attack success rate exceeding 90% across all tested models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prompts generated by Rainbow Teaming are highly transferable and that fine-tuning models with synthetic data generated by our method significantly enhances their safety without sacrificing general performance or helpfulness. We additionally explore the versatility of Rainbow Teaming by applying it to question answering and cybersecurity, showcasing its potential to drive robust open-ended self-improvement in a wide range of applications.

Title: Learning diverse attacks on large language models for robust red-teaming and safety tuning
Abstract: Red-teaming, or identifying prompts that elicit harmful responses, is a critical step in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Developing effective protection against many modes of attack prompts requires discovering diverse attacks. Automated red-teaming typically uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune an attacker language model to generate prompts that elicit undesirable responses from a target LLM, as measured, for example, by an auxiliary toxicity classifier. We show that even with explicit regularization to favor novelty and diversity, existing approaches suffer from mode collapse or fail to generate effective attacks. As a flexible and probabilistically principled alternative, we propose to use GFlowNet fine-tuning, followed by a secondary smoothing phase, to train the attacker model to generate diverse and effective attack prompts. We find that the attacks generated by our method are effective against a wide range of target LLMs, both with and without safety tuning, and transfer well between target LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that models safety-tuned using a dataset of red-teaming prompts generated by our method are robust to attacks from other RL-based red-teaming approaches.

Title: Influence of gender and marital status on susceptibility of persuasion strategies in advertisement
Abstract: The study has two main objectives: to find out what is the susceptibility of individuals to the persuasion strategies of Cialdini 's persuasive power according to gender and to determine some characteristics of users with different marital status in social influence. Cialdini's (2001-2021) persuasion strategies (principles), as well as Keptein's STPS (2009), were applied to measure the susceptibility to persuasion of individuals of both genders with different marital status. The results of an analysis of variance (ANOVA), measuring the influence of gender, showed that on the criterion of susceptibility to persuasion, males were more influenced by the following strategies: liking, reciprocity, authority, and social proof relative to females with the exception of the principle of commitment and consistency, and individuals who are divorced, separated and widowed responded positively to strategies such as social proof, scarcity and authority. Through regression analysis, social influence was found for unmarried users with respect to the reciprocity principle, as well as authority and scarcity when combining the latter strategies. Individuals who are cohabiting or married, as well as divorced, separated, and widowed, gave positive advertising responses to the scarcity principle, but cohabiting and married consumers exhibiting commitment and consistency under the influence of advertising. Hence, this study can serve organizations offering products and services through advertising, and its originality lies in the findings of mixed consumer responses regarding gender and marital status.

Title: Age differences in adaption of persuasion strategies in advertising
Abstract: This investigation has three aims: (1) to adapt and modify the STPS questionnaire - developed by Kaptein, Markopoulos, Ruyter and Aarts, (2009) as a basic instrument for measuring achieved social influence; (2) to establish susceptibility to Cialdini's persuasion strategies among different age groups; and (3) to determine the advertising effectiveness achieved through advertising messages- based on persuasion principles. The paper used 
 the adapted and modified STPS questionnaire, measured respondents' individual susceptibility to persuasion strategies relative to their age. The results of the univariate analyses of variance show achieved social influence among different age groups in terms of the principles. For respondents aged 46-55, the principle of social proof and commitment and consistency, are relevant; scarcity is significant for 36-45-years old, while authority is dominant for the 56-65 age groups. Positive correlations were found between the persuasion strategies present in advertising: the presence of the reciprocity principle enhanced the influence of the liking and consistency principles to the greatest extent, while the presence of the scarcity principle enhanced the influence of the authority and reciprocity principles. The consumers’ susceptibility to advertising is greatest when consumers’ willingness to purchase is measured against the principle of reciprocity, authority and social proof. On the other hand, offering a stimulus in advertising is most successful when the principles of scarcity, authority, and commitment /consistency are present, and least successful when the principle of liking is present. In older age groups, different consumer sensitivity to persuasion in advertising can be achieved with different combinations of persuasion strategies. These research findings are useful for organizations that offer products and services through advertising.

Title: The Influence of Time Pressure and Persuasion Principles on Phishing Detection
Abstract: Phishing is a pervasive threat with annually growing costs. Research has explored how users may be susceptible due to individual differences, email content, and situational factors. However, the influences of persuasive strategies and time pressure on phishing susceptibility remain unclear. The present study explored how the use of Cialdini’s six persuasion principles and time pressure (high vs low vs control) affect users’ abilities to classify 60 emails (50% phishing). Results indicated that time pressure influenced the pace at which users completed the task but was otherwise uninfluential. Rather, participants were generally insensitive to emails in all three conditions, indicating a potential floor effect. Additionally, persuasion principles influenced classifications. Users struggled to classify emails using the authority and commitment/consistency principles the most, and emails using the social proof, liking, and reciprocity principles the least. Overall, our findings suggest that users struggle to identify persuasive phishing attacks, regardless of time pressure.

Title: Cannot or Should Not? Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs
Abstract: Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.

Title: Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization
Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (<3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.

Scientist4:Thought: The seed idea of "Cognitive Immunization" is compelling, as it draws inspiration from psychological inoculation theory to defend LLMs against persuasive jailbreaks. However, it focuses narrowly on preemptive exposure to weakened attacks. To expand this, I propose integrating *dynamic adversarial training* with *user demographic-aware persuasion strategies* (inspired by Papers 3–5) to create a more robust and adaptive defense. This approach not only immunizes LLMs against known persuasive tactics but also adapts defenses based on the inferred demographic traits of the attacker (e.g., age, gender, marital status), which influence susceptibility to persuasion. By combining adversarial robustness with demographic-aware adaptation, this idea addresses a gap in current defenses: static immunization ignores contextual factors that make attacks more effective for certain users. The novelty lies in the fusion of adversarial training, demographic modeling, and real-time adaptation, offering a more holistic defense.

{
  "Idea": "This paper introduces *Demographic-Aware Adversarial Immunization (DAAI)*, a novel defense framework for LLMs that dynamically adapts to the inferred demographic traits of potential attackers while immunizing the model against persuasive jailbreaks. DAAI extends the 'Cognitive Immunization' concept by: (1) Leveraging demographic-specific persuasion strategies (e.g., authority for older users, reciprocity for unmarried users) from social science literature (Papers 3–5) to generate adversarial examples; (2) Training the LLM to recognize and resist these strategies through iterative adversarial fine-tuning, where vaccine prompts are dynamically weighted based on attacker demographics; and (3) Incorporating a lightweight demographic inference module to predict attacker traits (e.g., via linguistic cues or interaction patterns) and adjust refusal mechanisms in real time. For evaluation, we measure jailbreak success rates against baseline defenses (e.g., standard RLHF) across diverse synthetic attacker profiles (varying age, gender, etc.) and real-world adversarial prompts (e.g., Rainbow Teaming outputs). The impact lies in bridging AI safety with human-centric persuasion dynamics, enabling LLMs to preemptively 'learn' which defenses work best for whom.",

The potential to influence both AI safety and computational social science is high, though it requires empirical validation to reach transformative status.",
  "Feasibility": 6,
  "Feasibility Rationale": "Moderately feasible due to the need for demographic annotation and lightweight model training. The demographic inference module and adversarial fine-tuning can be implemented via APIs (e.g., GPT-4 for synthetic data) and limited hardware (e.g., LoRA for fine-tuning). Challenges include bias mitigation in demographic inference and computational costs for iterative adversarial training.",
  "Novelty": 8,
  "Novelty Rationale": "The integration of demographic-aware defenses with adversarial immunization is clearly novel. While adversarial training and persuasion strategies exist separately (Papers 1–2, 3–5), their combination for dynamic LLM safety is unexplored. The closest work (Paper 6) focuses on refusal taxonomy, not demographic adaptation."
