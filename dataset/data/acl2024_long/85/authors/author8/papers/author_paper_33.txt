    "title": "Lossless Speedup of Autoregressive Translation with Generalized Aggressive Decoding",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Generalized Aggressive Decoding (GAD) \u2013 a novel decoding paradigm for speeding up autoregressive translation without quality loss, through the collaboration of autoregressive and non-autoregressive translation (NAT) of the Transformer. At each decoding iteration, GAD aggressively decodes a number of tokens in parallel as a draft with NAT and then veri\ufb01es them in the autoregressive manner, where only the tokens that pass the veri\ufb01cation are kept as decoded tokens. GAD can achieve the same performance as autoregressive translation but much more ef\ufb01ciently because both NAT drafting and autoregressive veri\ufb01cation are fast due to parallel computing. We conduct experiments in the WMT14 English-German translation task and con\ufb01rm that the vanilla GAD yields exactly the same results as greedy decoding with an around 3 \u00d7 speedup, and that its variant (GAD++) with an advanced veri\ufb01cation strategy not only outperforms the greedy translation and even achieves the comparable translation quality with the beam search result, but also further improves the decoding speed, resulting in an around 5 \u00d7 speedup over autoregressive translation.
