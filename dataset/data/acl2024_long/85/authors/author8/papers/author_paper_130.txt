    "title": "The Construction of language Resource and Knowledge Base for Chinese Language Computing",
    "abstract": "With the urgent needs of enhancing the intelligence of the internet, Knowledge engineering is attracting high attention from both industry and academia. Different from the knowledge engineering (such as Dbpedia, Knowledge Graph, YAGO, etc.) based on structured knowledge resources, the task of textual knowledge engineering is to mine knowledge from unstructured natural language texts. One of the critical problems is, there is gap between the shallow structures expressed by natural languages and the deep structures in conceptual knowledge. In this talk we will introduce the building of the multi-level annotated Chinese language resource, the ontology engineering based on encyclopedias and the Web, and the construction of the mapping resource between conceptual relations and their natural language expressions to link linguistic knowledge and the world knowledge together. The ultimate goal is to lay resource foundation for Chinese language computing in the Web scale. BIO: Zhifang Sui, Professor of Institute of Computational Linguistics, Peking University.
