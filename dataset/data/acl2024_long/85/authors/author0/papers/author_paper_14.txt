    "title": "SmartSales: Sales Script Extraction and Analysis from Sales Chatlog",
    "abstract": "In modern sales applications, automatic script extraction and management greatly decrease the need for human labor to collect the winning sales scripts, which largely boost the success rate for sales and can be shared across the sales teams. In this work, we present the SmartSales system to serve both the sales representatives and managers to attain the sales insights from the large-scale sales chatlog. SmartSales consists of three modules: 1) Customer frequently asked questions (FAQ) extraction aims to enrich the FAQ knowledge base by harvesting high quality customer question-answer pairs from the chatlog. 2) Customer objection response assists the salespeople to figure out the typical customer objections and corresponding winning sales scripts, as well as search for proper sales responses for a certain customer objection. 3) Sales manager dashboard helps sales managers to monitor whether a specific sales representative or team follows the sales standard operating procedures (SOP). The proposed prototype system is empowered by the state-of-the-art conversational intelligence techniques and has been running on the Tencent Cloud to serve the sales teams from several different areas."
