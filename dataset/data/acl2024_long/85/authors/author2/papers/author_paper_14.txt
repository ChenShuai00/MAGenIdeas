    "abstract": "Objective: To explore the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, influence factors and interaction on HCV infection in patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in Taiyuan. Methods: Between April-June 2019, three MMT clinics in Taiyuan were selected to conduct a face-to-face questionnaire survey among MMT patients to collect the information about their socio-demographic characteristics, drug use, MMT, sexual behavior and health status. Software EpiData 3.1 was used for real-time double entry to establish the database. Software SAS 9.4 was used to analyze the data, and \u03c72 test was used for univariate analysis and logistic regression model was used for multivariate and interaction analyses. Results: A total of 903 subjects were surveyed among MMT patients, the male to female ratio of was 7.21\u22361(743\u2236103), and the rate of HCV infection was 12.53% (106/846). After adjusting for the confounding factors, being women (OR=1.936, 95%CI: 1.023-3.662), having sex with drug users (OR=2.073, 95%CI: 1.110-3.871) and injection drug use (OR=7.737, 95%CI: 4.614-12.973) might be the risk factors for HCV infection in patients receiving MMT. The results showed that there were multiplicative interactions among women, having sex with drug user and injection drug use on HCV infection. Conclusions: Being women, having sex with drug user and injection drug use were associated with higher risk for HCV infection in patients receiving MMT in Taiyuan. There were multiplication interactions between being women and having sex with drug user, being female and injection drug use, and having sex with drug use and injection drug use on HCV infection."
