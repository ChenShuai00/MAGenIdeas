    "Title": "AdaptiveTranslate: Adaptive Multilingual Translation with LLMs and Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes AdaptiveTranslate, an adaptive framework for multilingual translation that leverages LLMs and domain-specific fine-tuning to improve translation accuracy. The framework uses a fine-tuning module that adapts LLMs to specific domains, enabling it to handle domain-specific terminology and context. AdaptiveTranslate is particularly effective in handling low-resource languages and noisy speech inputs. The framework also includes a feedback loop that continuously improves translation quality based on user feedback.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Ziemann’s creative extension theory**, which emphasize the importance of adaptability and continuous improvement in solving complex problems. By using domain-specific fine-tuning, AdaptiveTranslate addresses the limitations of traditional translation methods and aligns with the target paper's goal of leveraging LLMs for better translation outcomes. The adaptive approach is novel and has the potential to significantly advance the field of multilingual translation.",
    "Rationale": "Traditional translation methods often struggle to handle domain-specific terminology and context, leading to suboptimal results. AdaptiveTranslate addresses this by using domain-specific fine-tuning, which is particularly beneficial for low-resource languages and noisy speech inputs. The framework's adaptability to different domains and continuous improvement based on user feedback make it a versatile solution for real-world translation tasks. Its potential to outperform state-of-the-art models makes it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
