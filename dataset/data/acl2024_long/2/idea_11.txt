    "Title": "HypoTranslate-X: A Unified Framework for N-best Hypothesis Optimization",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a unified framework for optimizing N-best hypotheses in translation tasks by combining reinforcement learning (RL) and LLMs. The framework will train an RL agent to select and refine hypotheses from the N-best list, maximizing translation quality based on a reward function that incorporates metrics like BLEU, TER, and human evaluation scores. The agent will also leverage LLMs to generate additional hypotheses on-the-fly, ensuring a diverse and high-quality set of candidates. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional beam search and top-1 hypothesis selection, offering a more dynamic and adaptive solution for translation tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Laudanâ€™s methodological improvement model**, which focuses on enhancing existing methods. Current translation systems rely on static beam search and top-1 selection, which may not fully exploit the potential of N-best hypotheses. By introducing RL and dynamic hypothesis generation, we can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of translation systems.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that N-best hypotheses contain valuable information that is often underutilized in current systems. By optimizing the selection and refinement process, we can achieve higher translation quality and robustness. This approach is particularly relevant for real-time translation systems, where accuracy and speed are critical.",
