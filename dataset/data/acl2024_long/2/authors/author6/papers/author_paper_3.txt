    "title": "Aligning Speech to Languages to Enhance Code-switching Speech Recognition",
    "abstract": "Code-switching (CS) refers to the switching of languages within a speech signal and results in language confusion for automatic speech recognition (ASR). To address language confusion, we propose the language alignment loss that performs frame-level language identification using pseudo language labels learned from the ASR decoder. This eliminates the need for frame-level language annotations. To further tackle the complex token alternatives for language modeling in bilingual scenarios, we propose to employ large language models via a generative error correction method. A linguistic hint that incorporates language information (derived from the proposed language alignment loss and decoded hypotheses) is introduced to guide the prompting of large language models. The proposed methods are evaluated on the SEAME dataset and data from the ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition challenge. The incorporation of the proposed language alignment loss demonstrates a higher CS-ASR performance with only a negligible increase in the number of parameters on both datasets compared to the baseline model. This work also highlights the efficacy of language alignment loss in balancing primary-language-dominant bilingual data during training, with an 8.6% relative improvement on the ASRU dataset compared to the baseline model. Performance evaluation using large language models reveals the advantage of the linguistic hint by achieving 14.1% and 5.5% relative improvement on test sets of the ASRU and SEAME datasets, respectively."
