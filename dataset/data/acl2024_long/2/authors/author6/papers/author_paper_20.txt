    "title": "Contrastive Speech Mixup for Low-Resource Keyword Spotting",
    "abstract": "Most of the existing neural-based models for keyword spotting (KWS) in smart devices require thousands of training samples to learn a decent audio representation. However, with the rising demand for smart devices to become more person-alized, KWS models need to adapt quickly to smaller user samples. To tackle this challenge, we propose a contrastive speech mixup (CosMix) learning algorithm for low-resource KWS. CosMix introduces an auxiliary contrastive loss to the existing mixup augmentation technique to maximize the relative similarity between the original pre-mixed samples and the augmented samples. The goal is to inject enhancing constraints to guide the model towards simpler but richer content-based speech representations from two augmented views (i.e. noisy mixed and clean pre-mixed utterances). We conduct our experiments on the Google Speech Command dataset, where we trim the size of the training set to as small as 2.5 mins per keyword to simulate a low-resource condition. Our experimental results show a consistent improvement in the performance of multiple models, which exhibits the effectiveness of our method."
