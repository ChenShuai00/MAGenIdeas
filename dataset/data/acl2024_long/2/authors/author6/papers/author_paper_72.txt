This project is a collaboration project among three universities: USM, MMU from Malaysia and NTU from Singapore. The Malay speech corpus consists of read speech (speaker independent/ dependent and accent independent/ dependent) and broadcast news. To date, 90 speakers have been recorded which is equal to a total of nearly 70 hours of read speech, and 10 hours of broadcast news from local TV stations in Malaysia was transcribed.
