    "title": "A Robust Real-Time Sound Source Localization System for Olivia Robot",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a robust real-time sound source localization system implemented on a social robot platform developed in Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore. The audio localization system provides the robot with auditory senses and enables the robot to direct its face to a speaker outside its frontal vision system. As the localization system exploits time difference of arrival (TDOA), the placement of the 8 microphone system array is crucial. This paper discusses the configuration and implementation of our system for the Olivia robot platform for accurate 3D localization under high babble noise condition."
