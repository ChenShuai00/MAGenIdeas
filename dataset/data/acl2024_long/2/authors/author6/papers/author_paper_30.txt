    "title": "A Unified Recognition and Correction Model under Noisy and Accent Speech Conditions",
    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) and its post-processing, such as recognition error correction, are usually cascaded in a pipeline ignoring their strong interconnection. Inspired by the recent progress of leveraging text data to improve linguistic modeling, we propose a U nified A SR and error C orrection framework ( UAC ), coupling speech recognition and error correction to capture richer semantic information for improving the performance of speech recognition. The proposed framework established interaction between speech and textual representations via explicitly fusing their uni-modal embeddings in a shared encoder. Additionally, the proposed framework is flexible to operate in either synchronous or asynchronous variant and could be equipped with modality and task tags enhancing its adaptation to heterogeneous inputs. Experimental results on accented and noisy speech datasets demonstrate that our method effectively produces improved word error rate when compared against the pipeline baselines."
