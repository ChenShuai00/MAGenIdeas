    "abstract": "Wound healing is a complicated and multistage biological process for the repair of damaged/injured tissues, which requires intelligent designs to provide comprehensive and convenient treatment. Peptide\u2010based wound dressings have received extensive attention for further development and application due to their excellent biocompatibility and multifunctionality. However, the current lack of intuitive analysis of the development trend and research hotspots of peptides applied in wound healing, as well as detailed elaboration of possible research hotspots, restricted obtaining a comprehensive understanding and development in this field. The present study analysed publications from the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection database and visualized the hotspots and current trends of peptide research in wound healing. Data between January 1st, 2003, and December 31st, 2022, were collected and subjected to a bibliometric analysis. The countries, institutions, co\u2010authorship, co\u2010citation reference, and co\u2010occurrence of keywords in this subject were examined using VOSviewer and CiteSpace. We provided an intuitive, timely, and logical overview of the development prospects and challenges of peptide application in wound healing and some solutions to the major obstacles, which will help researchers gain insights into the investigation of this promising field."
