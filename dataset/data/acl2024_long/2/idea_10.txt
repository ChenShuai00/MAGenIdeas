    "Title": "GenTranslate++: Leveraging Cross-Modal Fusion for Enhanced Multilingual Translation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a cross-modal fusion framework that integrates acoustic, linguistic, and visual information to enhance the generative translation capabilities of LLMs. By combining speech, text, and visual context (e.g., images or videos), the model can generate more accurate and contextually relevant translations, especially for ambiguous or culturally specific phrases. The framework will also incorporate a novel attention mechanism to dynamically weight the importance of each modality based on the input context. This approach aims to address the limitations of current translation systems that rely solely on text or speech, offering a more holistic solution for multilingual communication.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhnâ€™s paradigm theory**, which encourages exploring anomalies in existing paradigms. Current translation systems often fail to capture contextual nuances from non-textual modalities, which can lead to suboptimal translations. By integrating cross-modal information, we can address this gap and create a new paradigm for generative translation.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the increasing availability of multimodal data (e.g., videos with subtitles, images with captions) and the growing need for accurate translations in diverse contexts. By leveraging cross-modal fusion, the model can better understand and translate complex inputs, making it more robust and versatile. This approach aligns with the trend of multimodal AI and has the potential to significantly improve translation quality, especially for low-resource languages.",
