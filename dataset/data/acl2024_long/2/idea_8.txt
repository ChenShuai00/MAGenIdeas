    "Title": "ScalableTranslate: Scalable Multilingual Translation with LLMs and Distributed Computing",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces ScalableTranslate, a scalable framework for multilingual translation that leverages LLMs and distributed computing to handle large-scale translation tasks. The framework uses a distributed architecture to parallelize translation tasks across multiple nodes, enabling it to process large volumes of data efficiently. ScalableTranslate includes a fine-tuning module that adapts LLMs to specific languages and domains, further boosting performance. The framework is particularly effective in handling low-resource languages and noisy speech inputs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Hall’s dynamic system theory** and **Toulmin’s model of conceptual evolution**, which emphasize scalability and adaptability in solving complex problems. By leveraging distributed computing, ScalableTranslate addresses the limitations of traditional translation methods and aligns with the target paper's goal of leveraging LLMs for better translation outcomes. The scalable approach is novel and has the potential to significantly advance the field of multilingual translation.",
    "Rationale": "Traditional translation methods often struggle to handle large-scale translation tasks efficiently, especially in low-resource and noisy environments. ScalableTranslate addresses this by using distributed computing to parallelize tasks, resulting in faster and more efficient translations. The framework's adaptability to different languages and domains makes it a versatile solution for real-world translation tasks. Its potential to outperform state-of-the-art models makes it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
