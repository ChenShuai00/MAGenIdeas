    "title": "ParaCrawl: Web-Scale Acquisition of Parallel Corpora",
    "abstract": "We report on methods to create the largest publicly available parallel corpora by crawling the web, using open source software. We empirically compare alternative methods and publish benchmark data sets for sentence alignment and sentence pair filtering. We also describe the parallel corpora released and evaluate their quality and their usefulness to create machine translation systems."
