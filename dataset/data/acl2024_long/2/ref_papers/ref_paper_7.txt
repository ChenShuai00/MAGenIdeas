    "title": "Wav2code: Restore Clean Speech Representations via Codebook Lookup for Noise-Robust ASR",
    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has gained remarkable successes thanks to recent advances of deep learning, but it usually degrades significantly under real-world noisy conditions. Recent works introduce speech enhancement (SE) as front-end to improve speech quality, which is proved effective but may not be optimal for downstream ASR due to speech distortion problem. Based on that, latest works combine SE and currently popular self-supervised learning (SSL) to alleviate distortion and improve noise robustness. Despite the effectiveness, the speech distortion caused by conventional SE still cannot be cleared out. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework named Wav2code to implement a feature-level SE with reduced distortions for noise-robust ASR. First, in pre-training stage the clean speech representations from SSL model are sent to lookup a discrete codebook via nearest-neighbor feature matching, the resulted code sequence are then exploited to reconstruct the original clean representations, in order to store them in codebook as prior. Second, during finetuning we propose a Transformer-based code predictor to accurately predict clean codes by modeling global and local dependency of input noisy representations, which enables discovery and restoration of high-quality clean representations with reduced distortions. Furthermore, we propose an interactive feature fusion network to combine original noisy and the restored clean representations to consider both fidelity and quality, resulting in more informative features for downstream ASR. Finally, experiments on both synthetic and real noisy datasets demonstrate that Wav2code can solve the speech distortion and improve ASR performance under various noisy conditions, resulting in stronger robustness."
