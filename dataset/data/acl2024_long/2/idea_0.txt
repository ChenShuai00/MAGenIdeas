    "Title": "GenTranslate++: Leveraging LLMs for Dynamic N-best Hypothesis Fusion and Real-Time Translation",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the GenTranslate framework by introducing a dynamic N-best hypothesis fusion mechanism that adapts in real-time to context and user feedback. The system would use LLMs to not only integrate diverse translation candidates but also dynamically reweight hypotheses based on contextual cues, user preferences, and real-time feedback. Additionally, the system would incorporate a lightweight fine-tuning mechanism using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to adapt LLMs to specific domains or user needs without requiring full model retraining. This approach aims to improve translation quality, reduce latency, and enhance user experience in real-world applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Ziemann’s creative extension theory**, which emphasize improving existing methods by integrating new technologies and tools. The dynamic hypothesis fusion mechanism aligns with **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**, as it creatively addresses the challenge of optimizing translation quality in real-time. The use of LoRA for lightweight fine-tuning is based on **Hacking’s experimental system theory**, which focuses on improving experimental design and control.",
    "Rationale": "Current translation systems often rely on static N-best hypothesis selection, which fails to adapt to dynamic contexts or user feedback. By introducing a dynamic fusion mechanism and leveraging LoRA for efficient fine-tuning, this idea addresses these limitations while maintaining the scalability and efficiency of LLMs. The real-time adaptation capability makes it particularly suitable for applications like live translation and interactive systems, where user feedback and context are critical.",
