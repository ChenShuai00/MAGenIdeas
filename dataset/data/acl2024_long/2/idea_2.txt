    "Title": "GenTranslate-X: A Multilingual Translation Framework with Explainable AI for Low-Resource Languages",
    "Idea": "This idea extends GenTranslate by incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve transparency and trust in multilingual translation, especially for low-resource languages. The system would use LLMs to generate not only translations but also explanations for translation choices, highlighting the linguistic and contextual factors influencing the output. Additionally, the framework would include a data augmentation module that leverages web-scale parallel corpora (e.g., ParaCrawl) to enhance translation quality for low-resource languages. The explainability component would help users understand and trust the translations, while the data augmentation module would address the scarcity of training data for underrepresented languages.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** and **Sutton’s model of scientific serendipity**, which emphasize the importance of explaining and integrating anomalies to advance scientific understanding. The use of XAI aligns with **Reichenbach’s confirmation theory**, which focuses on evaluating and selecting competing theories based on their explanatory power. The data augmentation module is based on **Carnap’s inductive logic**, which emphasizes the importance of generalizing from multiple case studies.",
    "Rationale": "Low-resource languages often suffer from poor translation quality due to limited training data and lack of transparency in translation systems. By incorporating XAI and data augmentation, this idea addresses these challenges while improving the usability and trustworthiness of translation systems. The explainability component is particularly valuable for applications like legal and medical translation, where accuracy and transparency are critical.",
