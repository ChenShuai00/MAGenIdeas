    "Title": "CrossModalTranslate: Leveraging Cross-Modal Learning for Multilingual Speech-to-Text Translation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes CrossModalTranslate, a cross-modal learning framework that integrates speech and text modalities to improve multilingual speech-to-text translation. The framework uses LLMs to generate text translations from speech inputs, while also leveraging contextual information from both modalities to enhance translation accuracy. CrossModalTranslate includes a fine-tuning module that adapts LLMs to specific languages and domains, further boosting performance. The framework is particularly effective in handling low-resource languages and noisy speech inputs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** and **Lakoff’s conceptual metaphor theory**, which emphasize the integration of different modalities and perspectives to solve complex problems. By combining speech and text modalities, CrossModalTranslate addresses the limitations of traditional translation methods and aligns with the target paper's goal of leveraging LLMs for better translation outcomes. The cross-modal learning approach is novel and has the potential to significantly advance the field of multilingual translation.",
    "Rationale": "Traditional speech-to-text translation methods often fail to fully utilize contextual information from both speech and text modalities, leading to suboptimal results. CrossModalTranslate addresses this by integrating both modalities, which is particularly beneficial for low-resource languages and noisy speech inputs. The framework's adaptability to different languages and domains makes it a versatile solution for real-world translation tasks. Its potential to outperform state-of-the-art models makes it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
