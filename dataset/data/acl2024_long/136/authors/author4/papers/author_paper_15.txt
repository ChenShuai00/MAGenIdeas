    "abstract": "Hate speech is plaguing the cyberspace along 001 with user-generated content. Adding counter 002 speech has become an effective way to com-003 bat hate speech online. Existing datasets and 004 models target either (a) hate speech or (b) hate 005 and counter speech but disregard the context. 006 This paper investigates the role of context in 007 the annotation and detection of online hate 008 and counter speech, where context is de\ufb01ned 009 as the preceding comment in a conversation 010 thread. We created a context-aware dataset 011 for a 3-way classi\ufb01cation task on Reddit com-012 ments: hate speech, counter speech, or neutral. 013 Our analyses indicate that context is critical to 014 identify hate and counter speech: human judg-015 ments change for most comments depending 016 on whether we show annotators the context. A 017 linguistic analysis draws insights into the lan-018 guage people use to express hate and counter 019 speech. Experimental results show that neural 020 networks obtain signi\ufb01cantly better results if 021 context is taken into account. We also present 022 qualitative error analyses shedding light into 023 (a) when and why context is bene\ufb01cial and (b) 024 the remaining errors made by our best model 025 when context is taken into account. 026"
