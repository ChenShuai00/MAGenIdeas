    "title": "Generating Derivational Morphology with BERT",
    "abstract": "Can BERT generate derivationally complex words? We present the first study investigating this question. We find that BERT with a derivational classification layer outperforms an LSTM-based model. Furthermore, our experiments show that the input segmentation crucially impacts BERT's derivational knowledge, both during training and inference."
