    "title": "Wikipedia Revision Toolkit: Efficiently Accessing Wikipedia\u2019s Edit History",
    "abstract": "We present an open-source toolkit which allows (i) to reconstruct past states of Wikipedia, and (ii) to ef\ufb01ciently access the edit history of Wikipedia articles. Reconstructing past states of Wikipedia is a pre-requisite for reproducing previous experimental work based on Wikipedia. Beyond that, the edit history of Wikipedia articles has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for NLP, but access is severely impeded by the lack of ef\ufb01cient tools for managing the huge amount of provided data. By using a dedicated storage format, our toolkit massively decreases the data volume to less than 2% of the original size, and at the same time provides an easy-to-use interface to access the re-vision data. The language-independent design allows to process any language represented in Wikipedia. We expect this work to consolidate NLP research using Wikipedia in general, and to foster research making use of the knowledge encoded in Wikipedia\u2019s edit history."
