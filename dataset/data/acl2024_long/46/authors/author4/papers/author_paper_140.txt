    "title": "Claim Validation by Humans and Machines: Where We Are and the Road Ahead",
    "abstract": "Claim validation is a highly demanding expert task which prevents the proliferation of mis-information. In the recent years, we have seen a rapidly increasing interest in this problem domain. This interest is due to both the task significance and the impressive advances in AI-/NLP-based approaches. The talk will present novel datasets and problem definitions and experimental results related to automated claim validation. Besides, it will discuss our recent work on open-domain argument retrieval and clustering for human claim validation. We will conclude by outlining some open challenges for future research. Short Bio Iryna Gurevych is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany. She is the founding Director of the UKP Lab an of the Research Training Group \u201cAdaptive Preparation of Information from Heterogeneous Sources\u201d (AIPHES), funded by the German Research Foundation. Iryna has a broad range of research interests in natural language processing, with a focus on computational argumentation, computational lexical semantics, question answering and summarization. She has recently served as the PC Co-Chair of ACL 2018 in Melbourne, Australia. Also, she co-founded and co-organized the workshop series \u201cCollaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources and their Applications to NLP\u201d and \u201cArgument Mining\u201d. She co-authored the book \u201cLinked Lexical Knowledge Bases: Foundations and Applications\u201d (2016). She is the recipient of the Emmy Noether Early Career Award from the German Research Foundation (2007) and the interdisciplinary Lichtenberg Professorship Award by the Volkswagen Foundation (2008)."
