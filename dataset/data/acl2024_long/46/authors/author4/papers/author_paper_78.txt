    "title": "Focusing Knowledge-based Graph Argument Mining via Topic Modeling",
    "abstract": "Decision-making usually takes five steps: identifying the problem, collecting data, extracting evidence, identifying pro and con arguments, and making decisions. Focusing on extracting evidence, this paper presents a hybrid model that combines latent Dirichlet allocation and word embeddings to obtain external knowledge from structured and unstructured data. We study the task of sentence-level argument mining, as arguments mostly require some degree of world knowledge to be identified and understood. Given a topic and a sentence, the goal is to classify whether a sentence represents an argument in regard to the topic. We use a topic model to extract topic- and sentence-specific evidence from the structured knowledge base Wikidata, building a graph based on the cosine similarity between the entity word vectors of Wikidata and the vector of the given sentence. Also, we build a second graph based on topic-specific articles found via Google to tackle the general incompleteness of structured knowledge bases. Combining these graphs, we obtain a graph-based model which, as our evaluation shows, successfully capitalizes on both structured and unstructured data."
