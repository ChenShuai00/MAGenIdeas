    "title": "MDSWriter: Annotation Tool for Creating High-Quality Multi-Document Summarization Corpora",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present MDSWriter, a novel open-source annotation tool for creating multi-document summarization corpora. A major innovation of our tool is that we divide the complex summarization task into multiple steps which enables us to efficiently guide the annotators, to store all their intermediate results, and to record user-system interaction data. This allows for evaluating the individual components of a complex summarization system and learning from the human writing process. MDSWriter is highly flexible and can be adapted to various other tasks."
