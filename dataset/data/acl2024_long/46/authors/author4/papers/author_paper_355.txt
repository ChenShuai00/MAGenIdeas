    "title": "FrameNet on the Way to Babel: Creating a Bilingual FrameNet Using Wiktionary as Interlingual Connection",
    "abstract": "We present a new bilingual FrameNet lexicon for English and German. It is created through a simple, but powerful approach to construct a FrameNet in any language using Wiktionary as an interlingual representation. Our approach is based on a sense alignment of FrameNet and Wiktionary, and subsequent translation disambiguation into the target language. We perform a detailed evaluation of the created resource and a discussion of Wiktionary as an interlingual connection for the cross-language transfer of lexicalsemantic resources. The created resource is publicly available at http://www. ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/fnwkde/."
