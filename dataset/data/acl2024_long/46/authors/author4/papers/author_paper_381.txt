    "abstract": "This paper describes UKP\u2019s participation in the cross-lingual link discovery task at NTCIR-10 (CrossLink2). The task addressed in our work is to find valid anchor texts from a Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) Wikipedia page and retrieve the corresponding target Wiki pages in the English language. The CrossLink framework was developed based on our previous CrossLink system that works on the opposite directions of the language pairs, i.e. discovered anchor texts from English Wikipedia pages and their corresponding targets in CJK languages. The framework consists of anchor selection, anchor ranking, anchor translation, and target discovery sub-modules. Each sub-module in the framework has been shown to work well both in monolingual settings and English to CJK language pairs. We seek to find out whether the approach that worked very well for English to CJK would still work for CJK to English. We use the same experimental settings that were used in our previous participation, and our experimental runs show that the CJK-toEnglish CrossLink task is a much harder task when using the same resources as the English-to-CJK one."
