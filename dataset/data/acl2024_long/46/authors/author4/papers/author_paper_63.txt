    "abstract": "Relevant to all application domains where it is 001 important to get at the reasons underlying deci-002 sions and sentiments, argument mining seeks 003 to obtain structured arguments from unstruc-004 tured text and has been addressed recently by 005 approaches typically involving some feature 006 and/or neural architecture engineering. 007 By embracing a transfer learning viewpoint, the 008 aim of this paper is to empirically assess the po-009 tential of transferring knowledge learned with 010 confluent tasks to argument mining by means of 011 a systematic study with a wide range of sources 012 of related knowledge possibly suitable to lever-013 age argument mining. 014 This permitted to gain new empirically based 015 insights into the argument mining task while 016 establishing also new state of the art levels of 017 performance for the three main sub-tasks in ar-018 gument mining, viz. identification of argument 019 components, classification of the components, 020 and determination of the relation among them, 021 with a leaner approach that dispenses with heav-022 ier feature and model engineering. 023"
