    "title": "Pilot Experiments of Hypothesis Validation Through Evidence Detection for Historians",
    "abstract": "Historians spend a large amount of time in archives reading documents to pick out the small text quote they can use as evidence. This is a time consuming task that automated evidence detection promises to speed up significantly. However, no evidence detection method has been tested on a dataset that contains hypotheses and evidence created by humanities researchers. Furthermore, no research has yet been conducted to understand how historians approach this task of developing hypotheses and finding evidence. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of 16 students of the humanities in developing and validating hypotheses and show that there is no canonical user; even when given the same exercise, they develop different hypotheses and annotate different text snippets as evidence; and current state-of-the-art argument mining methods are not suitable for historical validation of hypotheses. We therefore conclude that an evidence detection method must be trained interactively to adapt to the user\u2019s needs."
