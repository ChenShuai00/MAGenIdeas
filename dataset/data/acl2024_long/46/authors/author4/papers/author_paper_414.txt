    "title": "UKP at CrossLink: Anchor Text Translation for Cross-lingual Link Discovery",
    "abstract": "This paper describes UKP\u2019s participation in the cross-lingual link discovery (CLLD) task at NTCIR-9. The given task is to find valid anchor texts from a new English Wikipedia page and retrieve the corresponding target Wiki pages in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. We have developed a CLLD framework consisting of anchor selection, anchor ranking, anchor translation, and target discovery subtasks, and discovered anchor texts from English Wikipedia pages and their corresponding targets in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. For anchor selection, anchor ranking, and target discovery, we have largely utilized the state-ofthe-art monolingual approaches. For anchor translation, we utilize a translation resource constructed from Wikipedia itself in addition to exploring a number of methods that have been widely used for short phrase translation. Our formal runs performed very competitively compared to other participants\u2019 systems. Our system came first in the English2-Chinese and the English-2-Korean F2F with manual assessment and A2F with Wikipedia ground truth assessment evaluations using Mean-Average-Precision (MAP) measure."
