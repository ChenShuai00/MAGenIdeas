    "title": "Cross-Lingual Distributional Profiles of Concepts for Measuring Semantic Distance",
    "abstract": "We present the idea of estimating semantic distance in one, possibly resource-poor, language using a knowledge source in another, possibly resource-rich, language. We do so by creating cross-lingual distributional profiles of concepts, using a bilingual lexicon and a bootstrapping algorithm, but without the use of any sense-annotated data or word-aligned corpora. The cross-lingual measures of semantic distance are evaluated on two tasks: (1) estimating semantic distance between words and ranking the word pairs according to semantic distance, and (2) solving Reader\u2019s Digest \u2018Word Power\u2019 problems. In task (1), cross-lingual measures are superior to conventional monolingual measures based on a wordnet. In task (2), cross-lingual measures are able to solve more problems correctly, and despite scores being affected by many tied answers, their overall performance is again better than the best monolingual measures."
