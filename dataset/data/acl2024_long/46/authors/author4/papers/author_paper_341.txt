    "title": "A Language-independent Sense Clustering Approach for Enhanced WSD",
    "abstract": "We present a method for clustering word senses of a lexical-semantic resource by mapping them to those of another sense inventory. This is a promising way of reducing polysemy in sense inventories and consequently improving word sense disambiguation performance. In contrast to previous approaches, we use Dijkstra-WSA, a parameterizable alignment algorithm which is largely resource- and language-agnostic. To demonstrate this, we apply our technique to GermaNet, the German equivalent to WordNet. The GermaNet sense clusterings we induce through alignments to various collaboratively constructed resources achieve a significant boost in accuracy, even though our method is far less complex and less dependent on language-specific knowledge than past approaches."
