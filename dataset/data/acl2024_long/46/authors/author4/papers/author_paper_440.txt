    "abstract": "Welcome to the proceedings of the ACL Workshop \"The People's Web Meets NLP: Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources\". The workshop attracted 21 submissions, of which 9 are included in these proceedings. We are gratified by this level of interest. \n \nThis workshop was motivated by the observation that the NLP community is currently considerably influenced by online resources, which are collaboratively constructed by ordinary users on the Web. In many works, such resources have been used as semantic resources overcoming the knowledge acquisition bottleneck and coverage problems pertinent to conventional lexical semantic resources. The resource that has gained the greatest popularity in this respect so far is Wikipedia. However, the scope of the workshop deliberately exceeded Wikipedia. We are happy that the proceedings include papers on resources such as Wiktionary, Mechanical Turk, or creating semantic resources through online games. This encourages us in our belief that collaboratively constructed semantic resources are of growing interest for the natural language processing community. \n \nWe should also add that we hoped to bring together researchers from both worlds: those using collaboratively created resources in NLP applications and those using NLP applications for improving the resources or extracting different types of semantic information from them. This is also reflected in the proceedings, although the stronger interest was taken in using semantic resources for NLP applications."
