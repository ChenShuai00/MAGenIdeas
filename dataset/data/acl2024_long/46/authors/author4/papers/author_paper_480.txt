    "abstract": "The Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Group at Darmstadt University of Technology pursues the vision of using information management, information retrieval, and text mining technologies to create innovative applications, such as intuitive information access in Web 2.0 (O\u2019Reilly, 2005) and eLearning. Thereby, semantic information processing technologies are utilized to transform unstructured information into structured knowledge for different media types, including text and handwriting. In order to support the interoperability of components created in various research projects of UKP, we decided to build upon Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004), released as an open-source project by IBM in 2006. The mid-term goal is to provide a collection of software components for semantic information processing based on UIMA, called Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Software Repository (DKPro). DKPro should support semantic information processing along several dimensions, such as:"
