    "title": "Argumentation in Social Media",
    "abstract": "Argumentation is a multidisciplinary domain at the intersection of philosophy, communication studies, logic, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, social sciences, political sciences, and law. Its study opens the door to a wide range of challenging, potential applications in several domains. One of the contexts in which argumentation assumes immediate relevance is the Web, since social media, social networks, and distributed platforms are some of the favorite sources and outlets for opinions, advice, and comments of any sort for a large share of the world population. The aim of this Special Section is to gather recent developments in the area of argumentation that is focused on social media. This Special Section of the ACM Transactions on Internet Technology collects a selection of seven articles on argumentation in social media. Each article has undergone at least two rounds of review by at least three experts following the highest standards. The article \u201cDebating Technology for Dialogical Argument: Sensemaking, Engagement and Analytics\u201d by Mark Snaith, John Lawrence, Barbara Konat, Katarzyna Budzynska, and Chris Reed provides a thorough overview of the emerging research area of debating technologies, which aims to develop instruments to enhance, support, and engage with human debating, and which has been the topic of a recent Dagstuhl seminar. The authors propose the Argument Web as a powerful unifying framework to exploit all the different aspects of this exciting research field. The induction of argument structures in online debates is the subject of the article \u201cUsing Argument Structure to Interpret Online Debate\u201d by John Lawrence, Joonsuk Park, Katarzyna Budzynska, Claire Cardie, Barbara Konat, and Chris Reed. The authors introduce a novel corpus of user comments collected from an e-rulemaking"
