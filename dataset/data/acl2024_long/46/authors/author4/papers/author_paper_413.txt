    "title": "Wikulu: An Extensible Architecture for Integrating Natural Language Processing Techniques with Wikis",
    "abstract": "We present Wikulu, a system focusing on supporting wiki users with their everyday tasks by means of an intelligent interface. Wikulu is implemented as an extensible architecture which transparently integrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques with wikis. It is designed to be deployed with any wiki platform, and the current prototype integrates a wide range of NLP algorithms such as keyphrase extraction, link discovery, text segmentation, summarization, or text similarity. Additionally, we show how Wikulu can be applied for visually analyzing the results of NLP algorithms, educational purposes, and enabling semantic wikis."
