    "title": "University of Birmingham High Accuracy Rule-based Question Classification using Question Syntax and Semantics",
    "abstract": "We present in this paper a purely rule-based system for Question Classi\ufb01cation which we divide into two parts: The \ufb01rst is the extraction of relevant words from a question by use of its structure, and the second is the classi\ufb01cation of questions based on rules that associate these words to Concepts. We achieve an accuracy of 97.2% , close to a 6 point improvement over the previous State of the Art of 91.6%. Additionally, we believe that machine learning algorithms can be applied on top of this method to further improve accuracy"
