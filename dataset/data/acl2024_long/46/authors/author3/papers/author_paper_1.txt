    "abstract": "We describe the second edition of the LongEval CLEF 2024 shared task. This lab evaluates the temporal persistence of Information Retrieval (IR) systems and Text Classifiers. Task 1 requires IR systems to run on corpora acquired at several timestamps, and evaluates the drop in system quality (NDCG) along these timestamps. Task 2 tackles binary sentiment classification at different points in time"
