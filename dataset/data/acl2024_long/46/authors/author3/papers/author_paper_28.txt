    "title": "Faster BERT-based Re-ranking through Candidate Passage Extraction",
    "abstract": "Most modern information retrieval systems employ a multi-step approach to retrieving documents relevant to a query, \ufb01rst retrieving a set of candidate documents before re-ranking the candidates. The most effective methods of re-ranking use a transformer-based classi\ufb01er to score documents. Since many documents exceed the input length of transformers, they are split into passages and each passage is classi\ufb01ed independently, aggregating the scores for an overall document score. As transformers are slow due to their quadratic attention mechanism, we investigate whether extracting only the most promising passages from documents as input for the classi\ufb01er can alleviate slow performance on longer documents at inference time while maintaining comparable performance. We explore three methods of passage extraction and \ufb01nd these approaches prove effective, performing comparably to the state-of-the-art while signi\ufb01cantly reducing the run-time, with the best results coming from a graph-based passage-ranking algorithm."
