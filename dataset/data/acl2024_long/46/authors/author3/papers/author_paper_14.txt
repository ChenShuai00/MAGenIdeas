    "title": "Extended Overview of the CLEF-2023 LongEval Lab on Longitudinal Evaluation of Model Performance",
    "abstract": "We describe the first edition of the LongEval CLEF 2023 shared task. This lab evaluates the temporal persistence of Information Retrieval (IR) systems and Text Classifiers. Task 1 requires IR systems to run on corpora acquired at several timestamps, and evaluates the drop in system quality (NDCG) along these timestamps. Task 2 tackles binary sentiment classification at different points in time, and evaluates the performance drop for different temporal gaps. Overall, 37 teams registered for Task 1 and 25 for Task 2. Ultimately, 14 and 4 teams participated in Task 1 and Task 2, respectively."
