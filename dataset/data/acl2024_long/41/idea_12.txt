    "Title": "Privacy-Preserving Context Embeddings via Homomorphic Encryption",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes the use of homomorphic encryption to create privacy-preserving context embeddings that can be shared between large and small language models in the CoGenesis framework. Homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it, ensuring that user context remains private. The small model on the local device would generate encrypted context embeddings, which would then be sent to the large model for processing. The large model would perform computations on the encrypted embeddings and return the results, which could be decrypted by the small model. This approach would enhance the privacy of the CoGenesis framework while maintaining its ability to leverage user context for better performance.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is derived from the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' theory (Laudanâ€™s methodological improvement model). The target paper highlights the importance of user context for performance but also raises concerns about privacy. Homomorphic encryption is a well-established method for privacy-preserving computations, and applying it to context embeddings is a novel way to address the privacy concerns in the CoGenesis framework. This approach is innovative because it combines the strengths of homomorphic encryption with the collaborative model framework, which has not been extensively explored.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that user context is essential for the performance of language models, but sharing context data raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic encryption provides a way to leverage user context without compromising privacy, making it an ideal solution for the CoGenesis framework. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards because it addresses a critical issue in AI (privacy) and proposes a novel, technically sound solution that can be implemented in real-world applications."
