    "Title": "Privacy-Aware Dynamic Model Switching for Context-Aware Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic model-switching framework that adaptively selects between large and small language models based on the sensitivity of the input context. The framework would use a lightweight privacy classifier to determine whether a given input contains sensitive information. If the input is deemed sensitive, the system would route it to a small, locally deployed model to ensure privacy. For non-sensitive inputs, the system would leverage a large cloud-based model for superior performance. The framework would also incorporate a feedback loop to continuously improve the privacy classifier and model-switching logic based on user interactions and performance metrics.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes identifying anomalies and exploring theoretical boundaries. The anomaly here is the trade-off between privacy and performance in context-aware LMs. By dynamically switching models based on context sensitivity, we address this anomaly while pushing the theoretical boundaries of collaborative LM frameworks. Additionally, **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is used to propose a novel hypothesis: that a lightweight privacy classifier can effectively balance privacy and performance in real-time.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the growing need for privacy-preserving AI systems, especially in personal devices. Current frameworks like CoGenesis rely on static collaboration between large and small models, which may not optimally balance privacy and performance. By introducing dynamic model switching, we can achieve better privacy guarantees without sacrificing performance for non-sensitive tasks. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards due to its practical impact, scalability, and alignment with the privacy concerns highlighted in top conferences."
