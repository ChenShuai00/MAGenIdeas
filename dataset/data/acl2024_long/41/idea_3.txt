    "Title": "Hybrid Model Compression for Efficient Local Deployment",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hybrid model compression technique that combines quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation to create highly efficient small models for local deployment. The compressed models would be specifically optimized for privacy-sensitive tasks, ensuring that they can operate efficiently on personal devices without compromising performance. The framework would also include a mechanism for dynamically adjusting the compression level based on the device's computational resources and the task's complexity.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Ziemann’s creative extension theory**, which focuses on extending existing methods through creative integration of new technologies. The current CoGenesis framework relies on standard small models, which may not be optimized for local deployment. By introducing hybrid model compression, we extend the framework's capabilities and address the efficiency gap. **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is also used to hypothesize that hybrid compression can significantly improve the performance of small models.",
    "Rationale": "Model compression is a key enabler for deploying AI models on resource-constrained devices. This idea addresses a critical limitation of the CoGenesis framework by optimizing small models for local deployment. Its potential to win best paper awards lies in its innovative approach to model compression and its alignment with the growing interest in efficient AI systems at top conferences."
