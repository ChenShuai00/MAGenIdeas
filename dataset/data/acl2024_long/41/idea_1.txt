    "Title": "Federated Fine-Tuning for Collaborative Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a federated learning approach to fine-tune small language models deployed on local devices while leveraging the knowledge of large cloud-based models. Instead of sending sensitive data to the cloud, the small models would be fine-tuned locally using federated learning techniques. The large model would periodically aggregate updates from multiple small models to improve its performance without directly accessing sensitive data. This approach ensures privacy while enabling continuous learning and adaptation of both large and small models.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which focuses on improving existing methods by integrating new technologies. The current CoGenesis framework lacks a mechanism for continuous learning and adaptation. By incorporating federated learning, we enhance the framework's ability to improve over time while preserving privacy. **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is also used to hypothesize that federated learning can bridge the gap between privacy and performance in collaborative LM frameworks.",
    "Rationale": "Federated learning is a natural fit for privacy-preserving AI systems, as it allows models to learn from decentralized data without compromising privacy. This idea addresses a key limitation of the CoGenesis framework by enabling continuous improvement of both large and small models. Its potential to win best paper awards lies in its innovative combination of federated learning and collaborative LMs, which aligns with the growing interest in privacy-preserving AI at top conferences."
