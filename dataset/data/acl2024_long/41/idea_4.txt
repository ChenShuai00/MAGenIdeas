    "Title": "Privacy-Preserving Multi-Model Ensemble for Context-Aware Tasks",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-model ensemble approach that combines the outputs of multiple small models deployed on local devices to enhance performance while preserving privacy. The ensemble would use secure multi-party computation techniques to aggregate the outputs without exposing sensitive data. The framework would also include a mechanism for dynamically selecting the best combination of models based on the input context and the task's requirements.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**, which emphasizes identifying common patterns and structures across multiple studies. The current CoGenesis framework focuses on collaboration between large and small models but does not explore the potential of multi-model ensembles. By synthesizing insights from secure multi-party computation and ensemble learning, we propose a novel approach to privacy-preserving AI. **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is also used to hypothesize that multi-model ensembles can significantly improve performance while preserving privacy.",
    "Rationale": "Multi-model ensembles are a powerful technique for improving AI performance, but their application in privacy-preserving contexts has been limited. This idea addresses this gap by proposing a secure ensemble approach that aligns with the privacy concerns highlighted in top conferences. Its potential to win best paper awards lies in its innovative combination of ensemble learning and secure computation, which has broad applicability in privacy-sensitive AI systems."
