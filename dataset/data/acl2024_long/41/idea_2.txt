    "Title": "Differential Privacy for Collaborative Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes integrating differential privacy mechanisms into the CoGenesis framework to provide formal privacy guarantees. Specifically, the small models deployed on local devices would apply differential privacy techniques to their outputs before sharing them with the large cloud-based model. This ensures that even if the large model is compromised, the sensitive information remains protected. The framework would also include a privacy budget management system to balance privacy and utility dynamically.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Popper’s falsificationism**, which emphasizes critically analyzing existing methods and identifying their limitations. The current CoGenesis framework lacks formal privacy guarantees, which is a significant limitation. By integrating differential privacy, we address this gap and provide a more robust solution. **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is also used to propose a systematic improvement to the existing framework.",
    "Rationale": "Differential privacy is a well-established technique for providing formal privacy guarantees, making it a natural choice for enhancing the CoGenesis framework. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards due to its strong theoretical foundation and practical impact. It addresses a critical concern in privacy-preserving AI systems and aligns with the growing emphasis on formal privacy guarantees in top conferences."
