    "Title": "Explainable AI for Machine-Generated Text Detection",
    "Idea": "This idea focuses on developing an explainable AI (XAI) framework for machine-generated text detection. The system will not only classify text as human or machine-generated but also provide interpretable explanations for its decisions. The key innovation is the use of attention mechanisms and feature attribution techniques to highlight the specific linguistic features that contribute to the classification decision. This will enable users to understand and trust the detector's output, making it more practical for real-world applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Quine’s holism** and **Lakoff’s conceptual metaphor theory** (from Law 6: Construct and Modify Theoretical Models), which emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying structure and reasoning behind models. The referenced papers highlight the need for transparency in AI systems, particularly in sensitive applications like fake news detection. By incorporating explainability into the detection process, we can address this need and improve user trust. This approach also aligns with **Mayo’s experimental reasoning theory** (from Law 7: Designing Critical Experiments), as it involves designing experiments to validate the explanations provided by the system.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the growing demand for transparency and accountability in AI systems. By providing interpretable explanations, the proposed framework can help users understand the basis for the detector's decisions, making it more reliable and trustworthy. This approach is particularly relevant for applications where the consequences of misclassification are significant, such as in journalism and academia.",
