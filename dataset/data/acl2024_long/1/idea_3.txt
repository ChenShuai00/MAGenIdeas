    "Title": "Explainable AI-Generated Text Detection: A Human-in-the-Loop Framework",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a human-in-the-loop framework for explainable AI-generated text detection. The framework combines machine learning models with human expertise to provide interpretable explanations for detection decisions. The method uses attention mechanisms and saliency maps to highlight the most relevant features used by the model, allowing human experts to validate and refine the detection process. The framework is designed to improve both the accuracy and transparency of AI-generated text detection, making it more trustworthy for real-world applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which emphasizes the importance of integrating human expertise with scientific methods. The hypothesis, derived from **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, is that combining machine learning with human-in-the-loop validation can improve both the accuracy and explainability of detection systems. The use of attention mechanisms and saliency maps aligns with **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which highlights the need for new tools and techniques to address emerging challenges.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current detection methods often lack transparency, making it difficult for users to trust their decisions. By incorporating human expertise and providing interpretable explanations, the proposed framework can improve both the accuracy and trustworthiness of AI-generated text detection. This approach is particularly relevant for applications where transparency is critical, such as journalism and academia. The framework has the potential to set a new standard for explainable AI, making it a strong candidate for top conferences like ICLR or CVPR.",
