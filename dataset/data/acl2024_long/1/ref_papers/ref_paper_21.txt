    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the correlation between Twitter mentions and the number of academic citations of radiation oncology articles. Materials and Methods: We reviewed all 178 clinical manuscripts of the 2 most important radiation oncology journals and \u201cBrachytherapy,\u201d and all clinical manuscripts relating to radiation oncology from the top 10 impact factor oncology journals, published between January and February 2018. We collected the record of citations utilizing Scopus and Google Scholar platforms and the number of times an article was tweeted about using the \u201cAltmetric Bookmarklet.\u201d \u03c72 test was used to compare distributions between groups and the Pearson coefficient was used for correlations between the Twitter metrics and academic citations. Results: Overall, 71% of all articles were tweeted about at least once. There was a significant correlation between the number of tweets and the number of citations in Google Scholar (r=0.55, P<0.001) and in Scopus (r=0.59, P<0.001). The 11% of articles with a prepublication Twitter \u201cbuzz\u201d (defined as an article with \u226510 tweets before publication) had 3.6 times more citations in Scopus (mean: 14.8 vs. 4.2, P<0.001) and 2.9 times more citations in Google Scholar (17.8 vs. 6.0, P<0.001) when compared with papers with no \u201cbuzz.\u201d Conclusions: Presence on Twitter was correlated with the number of academic citations of an article in radiation oncology. This suggests that Twitter is being utilized by the oncology community as a platform to discuss and disseminate high impact scientific articles. The correlation between Twitter and increasing the number of citations of an article through larger dissemination and exposure requires further studies."
