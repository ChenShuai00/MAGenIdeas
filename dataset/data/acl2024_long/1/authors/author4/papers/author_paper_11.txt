    "title": "On the Cultural Gap in Text-to-Image Generation",
    "abstract": "One challenge in text-to-image (T2I) generation is the inadvertent reflection of culture gaps present in the training data, which signifies the disparity in generated image quality when the cultural elements of the input text are rarely collected in the training set. Although various T2I models have shown impressive but arbitrary examples, there is no benchmark to systematically evaluate a T2I model's ability to generate cross-cultural images. To bridge the gap, we propose a Challenging Cross-Cultural (C3) benchmark with comprehensive evaluation criteria, which can assess how well-suited a model is to a target culture. By analyzing the flawed images generated by the Stable Diffusion model on the C3 benchmark, we find that the model often fails to generate certain cultural objects. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-modal metric that considers object-text alignment to filter the fine-tuning data in the target culture, which is used to fine-tune a T2I model to improve cross-cultural generation. Experimental results show that our multi-modal metric provides stronger data selection performance on the C3 benchmark than existing metrics, in which the object-text alignment is crucial. We release the benchmark, data, code, and generated images to facilitate future research on culturally diverse T2I generation (https://github.com/longyuewangdcu/C3-Bench)."
