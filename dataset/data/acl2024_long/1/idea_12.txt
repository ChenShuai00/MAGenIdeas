    "Title": "Dynamic Thresholding for Adaptive Machine-Generated Text Detection",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic thresholding mechanism for machine-generated text detection, where the detection threshold is adjusted based on the context and domain of the input text. The system will use a meta-learning framework to adaptively learn the optimal threshold for different scenarios, such as news articles, social media posts, and scientific papers. The key innovation is the integration of domain-specific features and contextual information into the thresholding process, allowing the detector to maintain high accuracy across diverse text sources.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (from Law 4: Design and Improve Existing Methods), which emphasizes the need for continuous improvement of existing methods. The referenced papers highlight the limitations of static detection thresholds, which often fail to account for domain-specific variations. By introducing dynamic thresholding, we can address these limitations and improve the adaptability of detection systems. This approach also aligns with **Hacking’s experimental system theory**, as it involves iterative testing and refinement of the thresholding mechanism.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the observation that different domains and contexts require different detection thresholds to achieve optimal performance. By dynamically adjusting the threshold, the proposed system can better handle the variability in text sources, leading to more accurate and reliable detection. This approach is particularly relevant for real-world applications where the source and context of the text are often unknown.",
