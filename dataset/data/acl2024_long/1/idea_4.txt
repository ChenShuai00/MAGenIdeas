    "Title": "Meta-Learning for Few-Shot AI-Generated Text Detection",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a meta-learning framework for few-shot AI-generated text detection. The framework is designed to quickly adapt to new domains and language models with minimal training data. The method uses meta-learning algorithms, such as MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning), to learn a generalizable detection model that can be fine-tuned with a small number of examples. The framework is evaluated on a diverse set of domains and language models, demonstrating its ability to achieve high detection accuracy with limited data.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the need for innovative approaches to address emerging challenges. The hypothesis, derived from **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, is that meta-learning can enable few-shot detection by learning a generalizable model from diverse training tasks. The use of MAML aligns with **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which highlights the importance of leveraging advanced techniques to solve complex problems.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current detection methods often require large amounts of labeled data, which can be difficult to obtain for new domains and language models. By using meta-learning, the proposed framework can achieve high detection accuracy with minimal data, making it more practical for real-world applications. This approach is particularly relevant given the rapid evolution of AI-generated text, which requires detection systems to quickly adapt to new challenges. The framework has the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in few-shot detection, making it a strong candidate for top conferences like NeurIPS or ACL.",
