    "Title": "Temporal Dynamics in AI-Generated Text: A Novel Detection Framework",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel detection framework that leverages temporal dynamics in text generation. The framework analyzes the evolution of text over time, capturing patterns such as coherence, topic consistency, and stylistic shifts. The method uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers to model temporal dependencies and detect anomalies that are indicative of machine-generated text. The framework is trained on a diverse dataset of human and machine-generated text, with a focus on capturing long-range dependencies and temporal inconsistencies.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which highlights the importance of exploring new dimensions in scientific problems. Temporal dynamics in text generation represent an underexplored dimension in AI-generated text detection. The hypothesis, derived from **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, is that machine-generated text exhibits distinct temporal patterns that can be exploited for detection. The use of RNNs and transformers aligns with **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which emphasizes the integration of advanced tools and techniques to address complex problems.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current detection methods often ignore the temporal dimension of text, focusing instead on static features. By analyzing temporal dynamics, the proposed framework can capture subtle patterns that are difficult to detect using traditional methods. This approach is particularly relevant for detecting long-form AI-generated text, where temporal inconsistencies are more likely to occur. The framework has the potential to significantly improve detection accuracy, making it a strong candidate for top conferences like NeurIPS or ACL.",
