    "Title": "Multi-Modal Detection of AI-Generated Content",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-modal approach to detecting AI-generated content by combining textual analysis with other modalities, such as images, audio, and metadata. The system will use a fusion of deep learning models to analyze the consistency and coherence between different modalities, providing a more comprehensive detection mechanism. The key innovation is the integration of cross-modal attention mechanisms, which allow the system to identify discrepancies between modalities that may indicate AI-generated content.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** (from Law 6: Construct and Modify Theoretical Models), which emphasizes the integration of multiple perspectives and methodologies. The referenced papers highlight the limitations of text-only detection methods, particularly in the context of multi-modal content like social media posts. By incorporating multiple modalities, we can address these limitations and improve detection accuracy. This approach also aligns with **Toulmin’s model of conceptual evolution** (from Law 10: Scientific Paradigm Shift), as it represents a shift towards more holistic and integrated detection methods.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the increasing prevalence of multi-modal content in real-world applications, such as social media and online news. By combining textual analysis with other modalities, the proposed system can provide a more robust and comprehensive detection mechanism. This approach is particularly relevant for detecting sophisticated AI-generated content that may use multiple modalities to appear more authentic.",
