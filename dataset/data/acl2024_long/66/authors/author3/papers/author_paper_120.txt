    "abstract": "In recent years, considerable attention has been given to studies on the role of playlists in music consumption. A study carried out in 2016, by the Music Business Association [6], showed that playlists accounted for 31% of music listening time among listeners in the USA. Another study, conducted by MIDiA [1], revealed that as many as 55% of streaming music service subscribers create playlists. Accordingly, music streaming services such as Spotify currently host over 2 billion playlists [9]. This evidence may indicate the growing importance of playlists as a mode for music consumption, and indeed the crucial necessity of developing algorithms for automatic playlist continuation, which is the focus of the ACM Recommender Systems Challenge 2018 [7]. In this paper, we \u2014 the organization team of this challenge \u2014 briefly discuss the particular task we defined for the participating teams. We also provide some information on the overall Challenge process. ACM Recommender Systems Challenge The Recommender Systems Challenge is a yearly competition focusing on creating the best-performing recommendation approach for a specific task and a specific scenario. From 2010 to 2017, the competition has drawn diverse participants from academia and industry [10,11,15]. Today, the Recommender Systems Challenge has become a key part of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems series, the leading conference in recommender systems research. The Recommender Systems Challenge has followed a similar structure since its inception: (1) a realworld problem is presented with a corresponding dataset, (2) researchers and developers form teams and sign up for participation, (3) participating teams submit their solutions prior to a deadline, (4) top participating teams submit papers that outline their approaches, (5) during a workshop at the ACM RecSys conference, accepted papers are presented and the winning teams are announced. c \u00a9 Markus Schedl, Hamed Zamani, Ching-Wei Chen, Yashar Deldjoo, Mehdi Elahi.

In MIREX, a few attempts to launch music recommendation [3] or personalized radio stationing [4] tasks were performed in the past, but they were never realized to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge. In comparison, by organizing the task in 2018 at the ACM Recommender Systems conference, we will reach a broader audience and with the full support of a major music streaming company, Spotify, we are sure to attract a remarkable number of participants. The MIREX task probably closest to ours is the Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval task [5], which has been run in 2016 for the last time. However, the organizers explicitly state that the task is \u201cnot playlist generation or music recommendation\u201d, rather pure similarity aspects. Another related challenge was the Million Song Dataset Challenge [2], which featured a traditional recommendation task: based on a part of the user\u2019s listening history, another, withheld part needed to be predicted. In contrast, our task explicitly considers hand-curated playlists, not listening histories. Automatic Playlist Continuation The task for the Recommender Systems Challenge in 2018 will be automatic playlist continuation (APC). This task consists of adding one or more tracks to a music playlist (of arbitrary length) in a way that fits the target characteristics of the original playlist [12,16]. APC is a useful feature for music streaming services not only because it can extend listening session length, but also because it can increase engagement of users on their platform by making it easier for users to create playlists that they can enjoy and share. As part of this challenge, Spotify will be releasing a public dataset of roughly 1 million user-created playlists. The dataset will include the title of each playlist, as well as the list of tracks, and some associated metadata, for each playlist. A separate evaluation set will consist of a set of playlists from which a number of tracks have been withheld. The task will then be to predict the missing tracks in those playlists, and participating teams will be required to submit their predictions for those missing tracks. An appropriate accuracy metric will be defined, which will then be used to evaluate the performance of each of the submissions. The dataset and associated evaluation metrics are scheduled to be released by the end of 2017. Up-to-date information can be found on the Challenge website. 1 1 http://2018.recsyschallenge.com"
