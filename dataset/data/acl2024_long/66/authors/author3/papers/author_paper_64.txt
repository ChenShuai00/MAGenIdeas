    "title": "Estimating the Entrance Surface Dose in the Eyes, Thyroid, and Parotid Gland Regions in Adult and Pediatric Groups: A Cone-Beam Computed Tomography Technique",
    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to determine the Entrance Surface Dose (ESD) of sensitive organs in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) imaging of the maxillofacial region in the two age groups of adult and pediatric. \nMaterials and Methods: In this work, the measurements were performed using Thermo Luminescent Dosimeters (TLD-GR200). The imaging was performed using a PROMAX 3D CBCT scanner for 30 adults and 20 pediatric patients. The ESD value for each patient in the region of eyes, thyroid, and parotid glands was measured by 15 TLDs during CBCT of maxillofacial. \nResults: The highest and lowest mean values of ESDs were related to the parotid and thyroid gland regions in adults, 4.77 \u00b1 0.61 mGy and 0.37 \u00b1 0.16 mGy, respectively. In addition, these values were obtained 2.97 \u00b1 0.36 mGy and 0.35 \u00b1 0.12 mGy in pediatric groups as the highest and lowest values in that order. The results showed that the ESD values of the parotid gland regions in maxilla and mandible examinations had a significant difference (P <0.05). In addition, there was a significant difference between the ESD values of the parotid gland regions among the adults and pediatric groups (P <0.05). \nConclusion: According to the results, the ESD values in both age groups were higher in the parotid gland region during maxillofacial CBCT examinations. Therefore, it is recommended to set radiation parameters like mAs as low as possible for reducing the patient dose, especially pediatric patients due to the more sensitive organs."
