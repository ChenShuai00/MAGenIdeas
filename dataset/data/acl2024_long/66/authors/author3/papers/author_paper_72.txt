    "title": "Learning a Joint Search and Recommendation Model from User-Item Interactions",
    "abstract": "Existing learning to rank models for information retrieval are trained based on explicit or implicit query-document relevance information. In this paper, we study the task of learning a retrieval model based on user-item interactions. Our model has potential applications to the systems with rich user-item interaction data, such as browsing and recommendation, in which having an accurate search engine is desired. This includes media streaming services and e-commerce websites among others. Inspired by the neural approaches to collaborative filtering and the language modeling approaches to information retrieval, our model is jointly optimized to predict user-item interactions and reconstruct the item textual descriptions. In more details, our model learns user and item representations such that they can accurately predict future user-item interactions, while generating an effective unigram language model for each item. Our experiments on four diverse datasets in the context of movie and product search and recommendation demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms competitive retrieval baselines, in addition to providing comparable performance to state-of-the-art hybrid recommendation models."
