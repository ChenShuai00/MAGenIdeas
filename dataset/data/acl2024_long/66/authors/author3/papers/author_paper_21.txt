    "title": "The cardioprotective effects of nano\u2010curcumin against doxorubicin\u2010induced cardiotoxicity: A systematic review",
    "abstract": "Although the chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin, is commonly used to treat various malignant tumors, its clinical use is restricted because of its toxicity especially cardiotoxicity. The use of curcumin may alleviate some of the doxorubicin\u2010induced cardiotoxic effects. Especially, using the nano\u2010formulation of curcumin can overcome the poor bioavailability of curcumin and enhance its physicochemical properties regarding its efficacy. In this study, we systematically reviewed the potential cardioprotective effects of nano\u2010curcumin against the doxorubicin\u2010induced cardiotoxicity. A systematic search was accomplished based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses guidelines for the identification of all relevant articles on \u201cthe role of nano\u2010curcumin on doxorubicin\u2010induced cardiotoxicity\u201d in the electronic databases of Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science up to July 2021. One hundred and sixty\u2010nine articles were screened following a predefined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ten eligible scientific papers were finally included in the present systematic review. The administration of doxorubicin reduced the body and heart weights of mice/rats compared to the control groups. In contrast, the combined treatment of doxorubicin and nano\u2010curcumin increased the body and heart weights of animals compared with the doxorubicin\u2010treated groups alone. Furthermore, doxorubicin could significantly induce the biochemical and histological changes in the cardiac tissue; however, coadministration of nano\u2010curcumin formulation demonstrated a pattern opposite to the doxorubicin\u2010induced changes. The coadministration of nano\u2010curcumin alleviates the doxorubicin\u2010induced cardiotoxicity through various mechanisms including antioxidant, anti\u2010inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. Also, the cardioprotective effect of nano\u2010curcumin formulation against doxorubicin\u2010induced cardiotoxicity was higher than free curcumin."
