    "title": "Towards System-Initiative Conversational Information Seeking",
    "abstract": "Presently, most conversational information seeking systems function in a passive manner, i.e., user-initiative engagement. Through this work, we aim to discuss the importance of developing conversational information seeking systems capable of system-initiative interactions. We further discuss various aspects of such interactions in CIS systems and introduce a taxonomy of system-initiative interactions based on three orthogonal dimensions: initiation moment ( when to initiative a conversation ), initiation purpose ( why to initiate a conversation ), and initiation means ( how to initiate a conversation ). This taxonomy enables us to propose a generic pipeline for system-initiative conversations, consisting of three major steps associated with the three dimensions highlighted in the taxonomy. We further delineate the technical and evaluation challenges that the design and implementation of each component may encounter, and provide possible solutions. We finally point out potential broader impacts of system-initiative interactions in CIS systems."
