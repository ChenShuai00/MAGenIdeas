    "title": "Cost-Effective Inclusion of Rankers : Learning When Not To Query",
    "abstract": "Combining multiple rankers has potential for improving the retrieval performance over using any of the single rankers. However, querying multiple rankers for every search request can often be expensive due to efficiency or commercial reasons. In this work, we propose a more cost-effective approach that uses the top retrieved results of a baseline ranker to predict the utility of including any additional rankers, without actually querying them. This approach is based on a novel learning technique, LTI, that maximizes the relevance gains that can be obtained by querying any additional rankers (effectiveness gains), while also minimizing the number of times these rankers are queried (efficiency gains). To evaluate LTI, we develop a combined measure that captures this trade-off in effectiveness versus efficiency. Our experimental results on a standard web collection demonstrate the viability of our approach to cost-effective ranker inclusion. Using easy-to-compute features based on the top retrieved results of a baseline ranker, the LTI method successfully adapts to different efficiency and effectiveness trade-offs and achieves on average a 7% improvement over a competitive classification baseline. In addition, we develop a method that automatically augments the training data using surrogate relevance data, which results in further effectiveness and efficiency improvements of up to 15%."
