    "abstract": "Query rewriting (QR) is an increasingly im-001 portant technique for reducing user friction 002 in large-scale conversational AI agents. Re-003 cently, the search based query rewriting sys-004 tem has been proven effective and achieved 005 promising results. It is a multi-stage system 006 that consists of two components orderly: re-007 trieval and ranking. Specifically, given a query, 008 a dual-encoder model retrieves top N rewrite 009 candidates. Then a Gradient Boosted Decision 010 Trees (GBDT) re-ranks the candidates by con-011 sidering semantic and information retrieval (IR) 012 features. However, although there is still a de-013 bate for the effectiveness of the neural ranking 014 model on traditional Learning-to-Rank (LTR) 015 problems, the neural LTR models for the QR 016 task have not been explored. To this end, we 017 first explore preliminary ranking models, in-018 cluding both tree-based (e.g., LambdaMART) 019 and neural-based (e.g., point-wise, list-wise) 020 ranking models. Furthermore, we propose a 021 context-aware ranking approach by integrating 022 the dialog context information into the rank-023 ing models. Experimental results demonstrate 024 that the proposed context-aware ranking model 025 outperforms the baselines significantly. 026"
