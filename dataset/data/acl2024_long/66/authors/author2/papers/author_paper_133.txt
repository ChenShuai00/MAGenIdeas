    "title": "Utilizing inter-passage and inter-document similarities for re-ranking search results",
    "abstract": "We present a novel language-model-based approach to re-ranking an initially retrieved list so as to improve precision at top ranks. Our model integrates whole-document information with that induced from passages. Specifically, inter-passage, inter-document, and query-based similarities are integrated in our model. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."
