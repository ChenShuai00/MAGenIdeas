    "title": "Who You Gonna Call? Optimizing Expert Assignment with Predictive Models",
    "abstract": "In open-ended tasks that require domain expertise, how do we assign experts that will perform the task well? Important use-cases like community question answering, peer review, hiring committees, and crowd-sourcing platforms all require assigning experts from a pool of users. Ideally, we would assign experts to tasks so as to optimize overall task performance, but expert performance is unknown prior to making the assignment. We propose predicting these performance metrics and assigning using the predictions. Using an expert-assignment task derived from StackExchange, we show that explicitly predicting expert performance has a large impact on assignment decisions and can improve overall welfare. We demonstrate this claim using both theoretical bounds on statistical generalization guarantees and automated metrics of assignment quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of predictive assignment, and the need to collect high quality datasets linking pre-and post-allocation measures in other important expert assignment tasks."
