    "abstract": "Detecting which parts of a sentence contribute to that sentence\u2019s toxicity\u2014rather than providing a sentence-level verdict of hatefulness\u2014 would increase the interpretability of models and allow human moderators to better understand the outputs of the system. This paper presents our team\u2019s, UTNLP, methodology and results in the SemEval-2021 shared task 5 on toxic spans detection. We test multiple models and contextual embeddings and report the best setting out of all. The experiments start with keyword-based models and are followed by attention-based, named entity- based, transformers-based, and ensemble models. Our best approach, an ensemble model, achieves an F1 of 0.684 in the competition\u2019s evaluation phase."
