    "title": "Generating Personalized Recipes from Historical User Preferences",
    "abstract": "Existing approaches to recipe generation are unable to create recipes for users with culinary preferences but incomplete knowledge of ingredients in specific dishes. We propose a new task of personalized recipe generation to help these users: expanding a name and incomplete ingredient details into complete natural-text instructions aligned with the user\u2019s historical preferences. We attend on technique- and recipe-level representations of a user\u2019s previously consumed recipes, fusing these \u2018user-aware\u2019 representations in an attention fusion layer to control recipe text generation. Experiments on a new dataset of 180K recipes and 700K interactions show our model\u2019s ability to generate plausible and personalized recipes compared to non-personalized baselines."
