    "title": "StylePredict: Machine Theory of Mind for Human Driver Behavior From Trajectories",
    "abstract": "Studies have shown that autonomous vehicles (AVs) behave conservatively in a traffic environment composed of human drivers and do not adapt to local conditions and socio-cultural norms. It is known that socially aware AVs can be designed if there exist a mechanism to understand the behaviors of human drivers. We present a notion of Machine Theory of Mind (M-ToM) to infer the behaviors of human drivers by observing the trajectory of their vehicles. Our M-ToM approach, called StylePredict, is based on trajectory analysis of vehicles, which has been investigated in robotics and computer vision. StylePredict mimics human ToM to infer driver behaviors, or styles, using a computational mapping between the extracted trajectory of a vehicle in traffic and the driver behaviors using graph-theoretic techniques, including spectral analysis and centrality functions. We use StylePredict to analyze driver behavior in different cultures in the USA, China, India, and Singapore, based on traffic density, heterogeneity, and conformity to traffic rules and observe an inverse correlation between longitudinal (overspeeding) and lateral (overtaking, lane-changes) driving styles."
