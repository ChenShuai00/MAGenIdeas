    "abstract": "Languages commonly use physical properties to discuss distinctly non-physical states and events in the world (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of licorice\u201d). Here, we investigate the degree to which associations between physical properties and abstract concepts are culturally speci\ufb01c constructs. To do this, we tested three distinct populations\u2014US adults, US children, and adults from an indigenous group in the lowlands of Bolivia, the Tsimane\u2019\u2014on their associations between the physical concept of weight and a variety of abstract attributes (e.g., importance, emotional state, moral worth). We \ufb01nd a strong relationship between the associations of US and Tsimane\u2019 adults, but little-to-no relationship between US children and either adult population. These results suggest that the property of weight plays a similar role in everyday thought across cultures, but that it takes time to develop. Further, we found that these associations could not be recovered from a simple semantic embedding analysis, suggesting that the cross-culturally shared connections between physical and abstract attributes may be learned through more complex experiences than language alone."
