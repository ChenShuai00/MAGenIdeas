    "title": "The Pragmatics of Spatial Language",
    "abstract": "How do people understand the pragmatics of spatial language? We propose a rational-speech act model for spatial reasoning, and apply it to the terms \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018near\u2019. We examine people\u2019s fine-grain spatial reasoning in this domain by having them locate where an event occurred, given an utterance. Our pragmatic listener model provides a quantitative and qualitative fit to people\u2019s inferences."
