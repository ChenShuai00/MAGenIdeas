    "title": "On the nature and origin of intuitive theories : learning, physics and psychology",
    "abstract": "This thesis develops formal computational models of\nintuitive theories, in particular intuitive physics and intuitive\npsychology, which form the basis of commonsense reasoning. The\noverarching formal framework is that of hierarchical Bayesian\nmodels, which see the mind as having domain-specific hypotheses\nabout how the world works. The work first extends models of\nintuitive psychology to include higher-level social utilities,\narguing against a pure 'classifier' view. Second, the work extends\nmodels of intuitive physics by introducing a ontological hierarchy\nof physics concepts, and examining how well people can reason about\nnovel dynamic displays. I then examine the question of learning\nintuitive theories in general, arguing that an algorithmic approach\nbased on stochastic search can address several puzzles of learning,\nincluding the 'chicken and egg' problem of concept learning.\nFinally, I argue the need for a joint theory-space for reasoning\nabout intuitive physics and intuitive psychology, and provide such\na simplified space in the form of a generative model for a novel\ndomain called Lineland. Taken together, these results forge links\nbetween formal modeling, intuitive theories, and cognitive\ndevelopment."
