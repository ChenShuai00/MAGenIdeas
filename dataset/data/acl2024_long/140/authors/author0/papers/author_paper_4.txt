    "title": "Dynamics of RNA localization to nuclear speckles are connected to splicing efficiency",
    "abstract": "Nuclear speckles are nuclear membraneless organelles in higher eukaryotic cells playing a vital role in gene expression. Using an in situ reverse transcription\u2013based sequencing method, we study nuclear speckle\u2013associated human transcripts. Our data indicate the existence of three gene groups whose transcripts demonstrate different speckle localization properties: stably enriched in nuclear speckles, transiently enriched in speckles at the pre\u2013messenger RNA stage, and not enriched. We find that stably enriched transcripts contain inefficiently excised introns and that disruption of nuclear speckles specifically affects splicing of speckle-enriched transcripts. We further reveal RNA sequence features contributing to transcript speckle localization, indicating a tight interplay between transcript speckle enrichment, genome organization, and splicing efficiency. Collectively, our data highlight a role of nuclear speckles in both co- and posttranscriptional splicing regulation. Last, we show that genes with stably enriched transcripts are over-represented among genes with heat shock\u2013up-regulated intron retention, hinting at a connection between speckle localization and cellular stress response."
