    "title": "Volumetric storage limits and space-volume multiplexing trade-offs for holographic channels",
    "abstract": "We consider M-ary signaling in page-oriented holographic storage systems that multiplex pages using three methods: conventional angular multiplexing throughout the volume, localized recording, and a combination of angular multiplexing within localized recording. We study the mutual information transfer, which is increasingly easy to achieve in practice, between the recorded and recovered data, and use it to assess the storage density in these systems. We use the existing holographic channel model for the dominant Rician noise case for deriving the mutual information bound on the capacity and examine the interplay between the storage density and the number of recorded pages within the medium. We quantify through information-theoretical analysis that it is possible to obtain considerably higher storage capacities using gated localized holography than what can be achieved in conventional volume holography with angular multiplexing by appropriately optimizing the number of intensity levels for a given material constant and signal-to-noise ratio."
