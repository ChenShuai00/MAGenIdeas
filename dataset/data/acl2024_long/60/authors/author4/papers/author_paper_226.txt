    "title": "Two-Dimensional Half-Rate Codes Using Two-Dimensional Finite-Field Filter Banks",
    "abstract": "This correspondence introduces two-dimensional (2-D) filter bank codes (TDFBCs). The synthesis bank of a two-channel two-dimensional filter bank over a finite field is used to design the 2-D code, and the corresponding analysis bank is used to generate the syndrome of the code. First, we study the encoder of half-rate TDFBCs and show that these linear codes are lattice-cyclic. It is proven that any 2-D lattice-cyclic code can also be generated by a 2-D filter bank. Second, we introduce a methodology to design TDFBCs over binary erasure channels. These codes have a simple and efficient maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding algorithm for burst erasures. We show that half-rate TDFBCs of dimensions N1 X N2/ can recover burst erasures of size up to N1 X N2 /2 and N1 /2 X N2 using the proposed decoding technique. Finally, we present examples of TDFBCs that satisfy the Reiger bound with equality, i.e., they are capable of correcting any burst of size N1 X N2 /2 ."
