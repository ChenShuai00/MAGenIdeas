    "title": "Structure Learning in Graphical Models from Indirect Observations",
    "abstract": "This paper considers learning of the graphical structure of a p -dimensional random vector X \u2208 R p using both parametric and non-parametric methods. Unlike the previous works which observe x directly, we consider the indirect observation scenario in which samples y are collected via a sensing matrix A \u2208 R d \u00d7 p , and corrupted with some additive noise w , i.e, Y = AX + W . For the parametric method, we assume X to be Gaussian, i.e., x \u2208 R p \u223c N ( \u00b5, \u03a3 ) , \u00b5 \u2208 R p , and \u03a3 \u2208 R p \u00d7 p . For the \ufb01rst time, we show that the correct graphical structure can be correctly recovered under the inde\ufb01nite sensing system ( d < p ) using insuf\ufb01cient samples ( n < p ). In particular, we show that for the exact recovery, we require dimension d = \u2126 (cid:0) p 0 . 8 (cid:1) and sample number n = \u2126 (cid:0) p 0 . 8 log 3 p (cid:1) . For the nonparametric method, we assume a nonparanormal distribution for X rather than Gaussian. Under mild conditions, we show that our graph-structure estimator can obtain the correct structure. We derive the minimum sample number n and dimension d as n & ( deg ) 4 log 4 n and d & p + ( deg \u00b7 log( d \u2212 p )) \u03b2/ 4 , respectively, where deg is the maximum Markov blanket in the graphical model and \u03b2 > 0 is some \ufb01xed positive constant. Additionally, we obtain a non-asymptotic uniform bound on the estimation error of the CDF of X from indirect observations with inexact knowledge of the noise distribution."
