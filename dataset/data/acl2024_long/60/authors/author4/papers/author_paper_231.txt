    "abstract": "Energyefficiency isaverycritical consideration inthedesign oflowcostsensor networks whichtypically havefairly low nodebattery life. Thisraises theneedforproviding periodicsleep cycles fortheradios inthesensor nodes. Keeping sensors insleep state alsoimplies thatnodetosinkcommunication incurs certain delays andthere exists athreshold on thedutycycling forthecommunication delay tobebounded, giving rise toanupperbound onthelifetime ofthenetwork i.e., thetimeuntil atleast onenodeinthenetwork isable tocommunicate itssensed datatothesink.Thispaper aimsatestablishing tight analytical bounds onthesleeping probabilities ofnodesandontheachievable lifetime ofwireless sensor networks inaverygeneric setting. Boundson thesleeping probability needtobesatisfied forproper networkfunctionality. Further, anenergyefficient deployment schemeissuggested wherein thebattery powerdepletion isfairly uniformly deployed throughout thenetwork. This schememakesuseoftheavailability oflowpowerauxiliary channel listening radio. Withthisscheme, weshownthat animprovement inlifetime bya factor of0( ) over uniform distribution ofnodesisachievable, wheren isthe numberofnodesinthenetwork. We alsoshowthatthe throughput capacity ofthenetwork isalsoimproved bythe samefactor. We showalsothatthemaxium lifetime of thenetwork isboundedaboveby0 (n3) Further, the 7\\log n accuracy ofouranalysis isverified bythesimulation results presented."
