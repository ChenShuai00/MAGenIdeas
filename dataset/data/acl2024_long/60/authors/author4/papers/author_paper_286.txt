    "title": "A hidden markov model-based approach for face detection and recognition",
    "abstract": "The use of hidden Markov models (HMM) for faces is motivated by their partial invariance to variations in scaling and by the structure of faces. The most significant facial features of a frontal face include the hair, forehead, eyes, nose and mouth. These features occur in a natural order, from top to bottom, even if the images undergo small rotations in the image plane, and/or rotations in the plane perpendicular to the image plane. Therefore, the image of a face may be modeled using a one-dimensional HMM by assigning each of these regions to a state. The observation vectors are obtained from the DCT or KLT coefficients. \nA one-dimensional HMM may be generalized, to give it the appearance of a two-dimensional structure, by allowing each state in a one-dimensional HMM to be a HMM. In this way, the HMM consists of a set of super states, along with a set of embedded states. Therefore, this is referred to as an embedded HMM. The super states may then be used to model two-dimensional data along one direction, with the embedded HMM modeling the data along the other direction. \nBoth the standard HMM and the embedded HMM were tested for face recognition and detection. Compared to other methods, our proposed system offers a more flexible framework for face recognition and detection, and can be used more efficiently in scale invariant systems."
