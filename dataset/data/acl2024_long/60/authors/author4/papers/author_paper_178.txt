    "title": "Scalable Video Multicast via Rateless Coding in Distributed Networks",
    "abstract": "Background and Context: In this project, we wish to develop multi-rate multicast schemes for heterogeneous (3STV) receivers. This is desirable form several points of view. Due to high bandwidth requirement of multimedia applications, multicasting is strongly demanded to reduce the network load. Multicasting, however, cannot solve the receiver heterogeneity problem. We propose the combination of multi-resolution representation (Scalable Video Coding) with multicast distribution. Multi-rate multicast is an efficient network transmission methodology for streaming a multimedia content to multiple heterogeneous clients. Unlike the conventional multicast that either overwhelms low-bandwidth receivers or starves high-bandwidth ones, multi-rate multicast delivers a content at different rates to receivers with different network capacities. As a result, every client enjoys a multimedia session at a quality according to his/her available bandwidth. In the following, we discuss various scenarios that benefit from multi-rate multicast via rateless coding."
