    "title": "RSSPN:Robust Semi-Supervised Prototypical Network for Fault Root Cause Classification in Power Distribution Systems",
    "abstract": "The power distribution system\u2019s fault root cause classification is an important but challenging problem. Traditional classifiers fail to achieve high accuracy and good generalization performance due to data insufficiency. A large volume of unlabeled data is available, which can be utilized to improve classification performance. This paper proposes a novel classifier called Robust Semi-Supervised Prototypical Network (RSSPN) based on Prototypical Network architecture and semi-supervised learning to address this issue. The proposed method can mine information from unlabeled data to improve the generalization ability and classification accuracy. Furthermore, RSSPN adopts the idea of meta-learning to obtain the \u201cfew-shot learning\u201d ability for identifying new fault classes using very few samples encountered during the operation and update online. Experiments have been conducted on a dataset consisting of 1152 labeled samples belonging to 12 different classes and 10000 unlabeled samples. The accuracy of the proposed method is significantly better than the traditional classifiers."
