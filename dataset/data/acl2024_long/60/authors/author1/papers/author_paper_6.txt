    "title": "Model-Theoretic Logic for Mathematical Theory of Semantic Information and Communication",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an advancement to Tarskian model-theoretic semantics, leading to a unified quantitative theory of semantic information and communication. We start with description of inductive logic and probabilities, which serve as notable tools in development of the proposed theory. Then, we identify two disparate kinds of uncertainty in semantic communication, that of physical and content, present refined interpretations of semantic information measures, and conclude with proposing a new measure for semantic content-information and entropy. Our proposition standardizes semantic information across different universes and systems, hence bringing measurability and comparability into semantic communication. We then proceed with introducing conditional and mutual semantic cont-information measures and point out to their utility in formulating practical and optimizable lossless and lossy semantic compression objectives. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the value of our theoretical propositions."
