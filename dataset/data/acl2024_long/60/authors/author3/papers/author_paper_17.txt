    "title": "Instruct-SCTG: Guiding Sequential Controlled Text Generation through Instructions",
    "abstract": "Instruction-tuned large language models have shown remarkable performance in aligning generated text with user intentions across various tasks. However, maintaining human-like discourse structure in the generated text remains a challenging research question. In this paper, we propose Instruct-SCTG, a flexible and effective sequential framework that harnesses instruction-tuned language models to generate structurally coherent text in both fine-tuned and zero-shot setups. Our framework generates articles in a section-by-section manner, aligned with the desired human structure using natural language instructions. Furthermore, we introduce a new automatic metric that measures discourse divergence in a fuzzy manner. Extensive experiments on three datasets from representative domains of news and recipes demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework in imposing discourse structure during text generation, as verified by both automatic and human evaluation. Our code will be available on Github."
