    "title": "On Reality and the Limits of Language Data",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural network language models have shown that it is possible to derive expressive meaning representations by leveraging linguistic associations in large-scale natural language data. These potentially Gestalt representations have enabled state-of-the-art performance for many practical applications. It would appear that we are on a pathway to empirically deriving a robust and expressive computable semantics. A key question that arises is how far can language data alone enable computers to understand the necessary truth about the physical world? Attention to this question is warranted because our future interactions with intelligent machines depends on how well our techniques correctly represent and process the concepts (objects, properties, and processes) that humans commonly observe to be true. After reviewing existing protocols, the objective of this work is to explore this question using a novel and tightly controlled reasoning test and to high-light what models might learn directly from pure linguistic data."
