    "Title": "Cross-Domain Reasoning Verification: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Reasoning Chains Across Multiple Domains",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes the development of a unified framework for evaluating reasoning chains across multiple domains, such as mathematics, science, and open-domain question-answering. The framework will use a combination of domain-specific and domain-general verification methods to ensure the logical correctness and relevance of reasoning chains in diverse contexts. The framework will be evaluated on a new benchmark dataset that includes reasoning chains from multiple domains, each annotated with domain-specific logical rules and constraints. The significance of this idea lies in its potential to improve the generalizability and robustness of reasoning verification methods, enabling them to perform well across a wide range of tasks and domains.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. By synthesizing insights from multiple domains, the framework provides a unified approach to reasoning verification that addresses the limitations of domain-specific methods. The development of a new benchmark dataset aligns with **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, as it identifies a critical gap in current evaluation methods and proposes a concrete solution. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards because it addresses a critical challenge in reasoning verification and provides a scalable, domain-agnostic framework that is highly relevant to top conferences.",
    "Rationale": "Current reasoning verification methods are often domain-specific, limiting their generalizability and robustness. A unified framework for cross-domain reasoning verification addresses this issue by combining domain-specific and domain-general methods, ensuring that reasoning chains are evaluated consistently across diverse contexts. This idea is significant because it improves the generalizability and robustness of reasoning verification, making it highly relevant to top conferences like ACL and NeurIPS.",
