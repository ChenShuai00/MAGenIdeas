    "Title": "Dynamic Fact Verification for Reasoning Chains: Integrating Real-Time Evidence Updates",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic fact verification system that continuously updates evidence used in reasoning chains. The system integrates real-time evidence retrieval and verification, ensuring that reasoning steps are always supported by the most current and accurate information. This approach addresses the challenge of outdated or conflicting evidence in open-domain question-answering tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Design and Improve Existing Methods (Laudan’s methodological improvement model)** and **Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings (Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings)**. The referenced paper 'Get Your Vitamin C! Robust Fact Verification with Contrastive Evidence' highlights the importance of adapting to factual changes, which motivates the need for real-time evidence updates. The target paper’s focus on attribution to evidence passages further supports the need for dynamic verification.",
    "Rationale": "Reasoning chains often rely on evidence that may become outdated or incorrect over time. By integrating real-time evidence updates, this system ensures that reasoning steps remain accurate and reliable. This approach addresses a critical limitation in current reasoning chain verification methods and has the potential to significantly improve the robustness of open-domain question-answering systems.",
