    "Title": "Logical Fallacy Detection in Reasoning Chains: A Fine-Grained Annotation Framework and Benchmark",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes the creation of a fine-grained annotation framework and benchmark for detecting logical fallacies in reasoning chains generated by language models. The framework will categorize logical fallacies into specific types, such as straw man, false dilemma, and circular reasoning, and provide detailed annotations for each fallacy type in reasoning chains. The benchmark will include a diverse set of reasoning chains from various domains, each annotated with the types of logical fallacies present. Additionally, the idea proposes the development of a neural model specifically trained to detect and classify logical fallacies in reasoning chains. The significance of this idea lies in its potential to improve the logical correctness of reasoning chains by providing a detailed understanding of the types of errors that occur and offering a targeted approach to addressing them.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Popper’s falsificationism** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. By critically analyzing existing reasoning chains and identifying specific types of logical fallacies, we can uncover the limitations of current methods and propose targeted improvements. The fine-grained annotation framework aligns with **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**, as it synthesizes insights from multiple studies on logical fallacies to create a comprehensive benchmark. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards because it addresses a critical gap in reasoning verification and provides a detailed, actionable framework for improving the logical correctness of reasoning chains.",
    "Rationale": "Logical fallacies are a major source of errors in reasoning chains, yet current verification methods do not explicitly target them. By creating a fine-grained annotation framework and benchmark, we provide a rigorous testbed for evaluating and improving the detection of logical fallacies. The development of a specialized neural model further enhances the practical impact of this idea. This idea is significant because it addresses a critical problem in reasoning verification and provides a concrete solution in the form of a new benchmark and model, making it highly relevant to top conferences.",
