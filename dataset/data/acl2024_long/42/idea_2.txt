    "Title": "Entailment Trees for Reasoning Chain Verification: A Structured Approach to Logical Consistency",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes using entailment trees to verify the logical consistency of reasoning chains. Each step in the reasoning chain is represented as a node in the tree, and the relationships between steps are modeled as entailment edges. The system evaluates the logical flow of the reasoning chain by checking the validity of each entailment step, ensuring that the final conclusion is logically sound.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Construct and Modify Theoretical Models (Quine’s holism)** and **Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies (Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory)**. The referenced paper 'Explaining Answers with Entailment Trees' provides a foundation for this idea, demonstrating the effectiveness of entailment trees in explaining multi-step reasoning. The target paper’s focus on logical correctness in reasoning chains aligns with the need for structured verification methods.",
    "Rationale": "Current reasoning chain verifiers struggle with logical consistency, as highlighted in the target paper. By using entailment trees, this approach provides a structured and interpretable method for verifying logical correctness. This idea has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of reasoning chain verification, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences.",
