    "Title": "Explainable Reasoning Chain Verification: Integrating Human-Interpretable Explanations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an explainable reasoning chain verification system that generates human-interpretable explanations for each verification decision. The system evaluates the relevance, attribution, and logical correctness of each reasoning step and provides detailed explanations for why a step is deemed correct or incorrect. This approach enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of reasoning chain verification.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Define New Scientific Problems (Kuhn’s paradigm theory)** and **Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings (Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings)**. The referenced paper 'Tell me why! Explanations support learning relational and causal structure' highlights the importance of explanations in improving reasoning tasks. The target paper’s focus on relevance and attribution in reasoning chains aligns with the need for explainable verification methods.",
    "Rationale": "Current reasoning chain verifiers often lack transparency, making it difficult for users to understand why a reasoning chain is deemed correct or incorrect. By integrating human-interpretable explanations, this approach enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of verification decisions. This idea has the potential to significantly improve the usability and reliability of reasoning chain verification, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences.",
