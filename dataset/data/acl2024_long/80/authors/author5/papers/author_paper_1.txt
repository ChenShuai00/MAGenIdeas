    "title": "Thematic Event Extraction Based on Event-Related Sentence Detection",
    "abstract": "Existing works in event extraction typically extract event arguments within the sentence scope. However, besides the sentence level, events may also be naturally presented at the document level. A document-level event usually reflects, to some extent, the theme (i.e., the main content) of the document (e.g., electronic medical records and news articles), which is thus referred to as the thematic event. Thematic Event Extraction (TEE) aims to extract the arguments of thematic events. TEE faces a major challenge, i.e., the sparsity and dispersion of arguments, which means that the arguments of a thematic event are dispersed in different sentences of the document. To overcome this challenge, we propose an Event-related Sentence Detection based TEE model, called ESDTEE, which first detects the sentences related to the thematic event and then extracts the arguments only within these detected sentences using existing models. Extensive experiments with comprehensive analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ESDTEE."
