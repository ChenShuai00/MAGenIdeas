    "title": "Survey on Big Data System and Analytic Technology",
    "abstract": "This paper first introduces the key features of big data in different processing modes and their typical application scenarios, as well as corresponding representative processing systems. It then summarizes three development trends of big data processing systems. Next, the paper gives a brief survey on system supported analytic technologies and applications (including deep learning, knowledge computing, social computing, and visualization), and summarizes the key roles of individual technologies in big data analysis and understanding. Finally, the paper lays out three grand challenges of big data processing and analysis, i.e., data complexity, computation complexity, and system complexity. Potential ways for dealing with each complexity are also discussed."
