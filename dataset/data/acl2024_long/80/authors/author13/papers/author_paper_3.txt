    "title": "Type-Representation Enhanced Event Detection via Structure Encoder",
    "abstract": "Event detection, aiming to detect whether a sentence contains the type of events of interest, is one of the important tasks in information Extraction. There exist many methods for event detection, which usually treat event detection as a classification problem. These existing methods suffer from the imbalanced training data of different event types. To relieve this problem, this paper proposes a new Type-Representation-Enhanced Event Detection (TREED) method, which introduce hierarchical event type representations to enhance classification accuracy. Specifically, TREED first models the hierarchical relationship among event types in the dataset; Next, upon interactions between the representations of trigger words and event types, it obtains the new representations of trigger words integrating event type information. Finally, TREED classifies the events based on the obtained more accurate trigger word representations. Experimental results on a commonly used benchmark dataset, ACE-2005, demonstrate that the proposed model can improve both accuracy and recall of the event detection task."
