    "title": "Stepwise Reasoning for Multi-Relation Question Answering over Knowledge Graph with Weak Supervision",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to automatically answer natural language questions via well-structured relation information between entities stored in knowledge graphs. When faced with a multi-relation question, existing embedding-based approaches take the whole topic-entity-centric subgraph into account, resulting in high time complexity. Meanwhile, due to the high cost for data annotations, it is impractical to exactly show how to answer a complex question step by step, and only the final answer is labeled, as weak supervision. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a neural method based on reinforcement learning, namely Stepwise Reasoning Network, which formulates multi-relation question answering as a sequential decision problem. The proposed model performs effective path search over the knowledge graph to obtain the answer, and leverages beam search to reduce the number of candidates significantly. Meanwhile, based on the attention mechanism and neural networks, the policy network can enhance the unique impact of different parts of a given question over triple selection. Moreover, to alleviate the delayed and sparse reward problem caused by weak supervision, we propose a potential-based reward shaping strategy, which can accelerate the convergence of the training algorithm and help the model perform better. Extensive experiments conducted over three benchmark datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."
