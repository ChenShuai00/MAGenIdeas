    "title": "An Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Topic Model Framework for Sentiment Classification",
    "abstract": "Sentiment classification aims to determine the sentiment polarity expressed in a text. In online customer reviews, the sentiment polarities of words are usually dependent on the corresponding aspects. For instance, in mobile phone reviews, we may expect the long battery time but not enjoy the long response time of the operating system. Therefore, it is necessary and appealing to consider aspects when conducting sentiment classification. Probabilistic topic models that jointly detect aspects and sentiments have gained much success recently. However, most of the existing models are designed to work well in a language with rich resources. Directly applying those models on poor-quality corpora often leads to poor results. Consequently, a potential solution is to use the cross-lingual topic model to improve the sentiment classification for a target language by leveraging data and knowledge from a source language. However, the existing cross-lingual topic models are not suitable for sentiment classification because sentiment factors are not considered therein. To solve these problems, we propose for the first time a novel cross-lingual topic model framework which can be easily combined with the state-of-the-art aspect/sentiment models. Extensive experiments in different domains and multiple languages demonstrate that our model can significantly improve the accuracy of sentiment classification in the target language."
