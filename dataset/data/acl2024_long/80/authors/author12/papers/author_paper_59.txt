    "title": "Coarse to Fine: Diffusing Categories in Wikipedia",
    "abstract": "Automatic taxonomy construction aims to build a categorization system without human efforts. Traditional textual pattern based methods extract hyponymy relation in raw texts. However, these methods usually yield low precision and recall. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically find diffusing attributes to a category from Wikipedia infoboxes. We use the diffusing attribute to diffuse a coarse-grained category into several fine-grained subcategories and generate a finer-grained taxonomy. Experiments show our method can find proper diffusing attributes to categories across various domains."
