    "title": "Semi-supervised Auto-encoder Based Event Detection in Constructing Knowledge Graph for Social Good",
    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have recently been extensively applied in many different areas (e.g., disaster management and relief, disease diagnosis). For example, event-centric knowledge graphs have been developed to improve decision making in disaster management and relief. This paper focuses on the task of event detection, which is the precondition of event extraction for constructing event-centric knowledge graphs. Event detection identifies trigger words of events in the sentences of a document and further classifies the types of events. It is straightforward that context information is useful for event detection. Therefore, the feature-based methods adopt crosssentence information. However, they suffer from the complication of human-designed features. On the other hand, the representationbased methods learn document-level embeddings, which, however, contain much noise caused by unsupervised learning. To overcome these problems, in this paper we propose a new model based on Semi-supervised Auto-Encoder, which learns Context information to Enhance Event Detection, thus called SAE-CEED. This model first applies large-scale unlabeled texts to pre-train an auto-encoder, so that the embeddings of segments learned by the encoder contain the semantic and order information of the original text. It then uses the decoder to extract the context embeddings and fine-tunes them to enhance a bidirectional neural network model to identify event triggers and their types in sentences. Through experiments on the benchmark ACE-2005 dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAE-CEED model. In addition, we systematically conduct a series of experiments to verify the impact of different lengths of text segments in the pre-training of the auto-encoder on event detection."
