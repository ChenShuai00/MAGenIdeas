    "title": "RIGHT: Retrieval-augmented Generation for Mainstream Hashtag Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Automatic mainstream hashtag recommendation aims to accurately provide users with concise and popular topical hashtags before publication. Generally, mainstream hashtag recommendation faces challenges in the comprehensive difficulty of newly posted tweets in response to new topics, and the accurate identification of mainstream hashtags beyond semantic correctness. However, previous retrieval-based methods based on a fixed predefined mainstream hashtag list excel in producing mainstream hashtags, but fail to understand the constant flow of up-to-date information. Conversely, generation-based methods demonstrate a superior ability to comprehend newly posted tweets, but their capacity is constrained to identifying mainstream hashtags without additional features. Inspired by the recent success of the retrieval-augmented technique, in this work, we attempt to adopt this framework to combine the advantages of both approaches. Meantime, with the help of the generator component, we could rethink how to further improve the quality of the retriever component at a low cost. Therefore, we propose RetrIeval-augmented Generative Mainstream HashTag Recommender (RIGHT), which consists of three components: 1) a retriever seeks relevant hashtags from the entire tweet-hashtags set; 2) a selector enhances mainstream identification by introducing global signals; and 3) a generator incorporates input tweets and selected hashtags to directly generate the desired hashtags. The experimental results show that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, RIGHT can be easily integrated into large language models, improving the performance of ChatGPT by more than 10%."
