    "abstract": "SemEval-2 Task 8 focuses on Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals. The task was designed to compare different approaches to semantic relation classification and to provide a standard testbed for future research. This paper defines the task, describes the training and test data and the process of their creation, lists the participating systems (10 teams, 28 runs), and discusses their results."
