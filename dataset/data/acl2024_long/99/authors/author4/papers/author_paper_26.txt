    "title": "CIS and CIGS nanomaterials prepared by solvothermal method and their spectral properties",
    "abstract": "Uniform CIS and CIGS nanomaterials were successfully synthesized by a simple amino\u2010based assisted solvothermal technique using PVP\u201030 as the surfactant. The influence of surfactant, temperature and Ga amount on the structure, morphology, phase and spectral property was analyzed in detail. The results show that CIS and CIGS nanomaterials with 40\u223c70 nm in diameter can be gained at 200 \u00b0C for 24 h. PVP\u201030 surfactant can greatly improve the dispersion characteristics of particles. XRD pattern shows that the \u201cthree peaks\u201d obviously shift to bigger 2\u03b8 after gallium implantation because of lattice contraction. EDAX and Raman show that the final product is close to CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2. The possible reaction mechanism has also been explained in detail. UV\u2010vis\u2010NIR spectra show that the absorption peak and absorption edge of CIGS with 1.278 eV bandgap obviously shift to a lower energy compared to CIS with 1.051 eV bandgap, which shows the potential application in enhanced conversion efficiency."
