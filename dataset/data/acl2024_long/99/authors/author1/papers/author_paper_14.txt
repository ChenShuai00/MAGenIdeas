    "title": "Re-creation of Creations: A New Paradigm for Lyric-to-Melody Generation",
    "abstract": "Current lyric-to-melody generation methods struggle with the lack of paired lyric-melody data to train, and the lack of adherence to composition guidelines, resulting in melodies that do not sound human-composed. To address these issues, we propose a novel paradigm called Re-creation of Creations (ROC) that combines the strengths of both rule-based and neural-based methods. ROC consists of a two-stage generation-retrieval pipeline: the creation and re-creation stages. In the creation stage, we train a melody language model using melody data to generate high-quality music fragments, which are stored in a database indexed by key features. In the re-creation stage, users provide lyrics and a preferred chord progression, and ROC infers melody features for each lyric sentence. By querying the database, we obtain relevant melody fragments that satisfy composition guidelines, and these candidates are filtered, re-ranked, and concatenated based on the guidelines and the melody language model scores. ROC offers two main advantages: it does not require paired lyric-melody data, and it incorporates commonly used composition guidelines, resulting in music that sounds more human-composed with better controllability. Both objective and subjective evaluation results on English and Chinese lyrics show the effectiveness of ROC."
