    "title": "The Imperative of Conversation Analysis in the Era of LLMs: A Survey of Tasks, Techniques, and Trends",
    "abstract": "In the era of large language models (LLMs), a vast amount of conversation logs will be accumulated thanks to the rapid development trend of language UI. Conversation Analysis (CA) strives to uncover and analyze critical information from conversation data, streamlining manual processes and supporting business insights and decision-making. The need for CA to extract actionable insights and drive empowerment is becoming increasingly prominent and attracting widespread attention. However, the lack of a clear scope for CA leads to a dispersion of various techniques, making it difficult to form a systematic technical synergy to empower business applications. In this paper, we perform a thorough review and systematize CA task to summarize the existing related work. Specifically, we formally define CA task to confront the fragmented and chaotic landscape in this field, and derive four key steps of CA from conversation scene reconstruction, to in-depth attribution analysis, and then to performing targeted training, finally generating conversations based on the targeted training for achieving the specific goals. In addition, we showcase the relevant benchmarks, discuss potential challenges and point out future directions in both industry and academia. In view of current advancements, it is evident that the majority of efforts are still concentrated on the analysis of shallow conversation elements, which presents a considerable gap between the research and business, and with the assist of LLMs, recent work has shown a trend towards research on causality and strategic tasks which are sophisticated and high-level. The analyzed experiences and insights will inevitably have broader application value in business operations that target conversation logs."
