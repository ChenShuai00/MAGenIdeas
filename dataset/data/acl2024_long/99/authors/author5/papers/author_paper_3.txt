    "title": "DEMO: Reframing Dialogue Interaction with Fine-grained Element Modeling",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made dialogue one of the central modes in human-machine interaction, leading to the vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. The dialogue's life-cycle spans from the $\\textit{Prelude}$ through the $\\textit{Interlocution}$ to the $\\textit{Epilogue}$, encompassing rich dialogue elements. Despite the large volumes of dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of benchmark that encompasses comprehensive dialogue elements, which hinders precise modeling, generation and systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce a new research task $\\textbf{D}$ialogue $\\textbf{E}$lement $\\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. On this basis, we further build the DEMO agent with the adept ability to model dialogue elements via imitation learning. Extensive experiments on DEMO indicate that current representative LLMs still have considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent performs well in both dialogue element modeling and out-of-domain tasks."
