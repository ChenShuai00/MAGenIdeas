    "title": "How to Understand Whole Software Repository?",
    "abstract": "Recently, Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have advanced the significant development of Automatic Software Engineering (ASE). Although verified effectiveness, the designs of the existing methods mainly focus on the local information of codes, e.g., issues, classes, and functions, leading to limitations in capturing the global context and interdependencies within the software system. From the practical experiences of the human SE developers, we argue that an excellent understanding of the whole repository will be the critical path to ASE. However, understanding the whole repository raises various challenges, e.g., the extremely long code input, the noisy code information, the complex dependency relationships, etc. To this end, we develop a novel ASE method named RepoUnderstander by guiding agents to comprehensively understand the whole repositories. Specifically, we first condense the critical information of the whole repository into the repository knowledge graph in a top-to-down mode to decrease the complexity of repository. Subsequently, we empower the agents the ability of understanding whole repository by proposing a Monte Carlo tree search based repository exploration strategy. In addition, to better utilize the repository-level knowledge, we guide the agents to summarize, analyze, and plan. Then, they can manipulate the tools to dynamically acquire information and generate the patches to solve the real-world GitHub issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed RepoUnderstander. It achieved 18.5\\% relative improvement on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark compared to SWE-agent."
