    "title": "DialCLIP: Empowering Clip As Multi-Modal Dialog Retriever",
    "abstract": "Recently, substantial advancements in pre-trained visionlanguage models have greatly enhanced the capabilities of multi-modal dialog systems. These models have demonstrated significant improvements by fine-tuning on downstream tasks. However, the existing pre-trained models primarily focus on effectively capturing the alignment between vision and language modalities, often ignoring the intricate nature of dialog context. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient prompt-tuning method named DialCLIP for multi-modal dialog retrieval. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-modal context prompt generator to learn context features which are subsequently distilled into prompts within the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP. Besides, we introduce domain prompt to mitigate the disc repancy from the downstream dialog data. To facilitate various types of retrieval, we also design multiple experts to learn mappings from CLIP outputs to multi-modal representation space, with each expert being responsible to one specific retrieval type. Extensive experiments show that DialCLIP achieves stateof-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmark datasets (i.e., PhotoChat and MMDialog) by tuning a mere 0.04% of the total parameters. These results highlight the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed approach, underscoring its potential to advance the field of multi-modal dialog retrieval."
