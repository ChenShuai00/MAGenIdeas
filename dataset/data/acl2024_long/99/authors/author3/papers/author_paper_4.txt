Originally, the Elo system was invented by a Hungarian physics professor, Arpad Elo, to improve chess rating system. Now many rating systems used in sports are based on the Elo rating system with modifications. The objective of this thesis project is to examine the Elo rating system for soccer tournaments and how it can be applied to the 2017 UEFA Women\u2019s Championship (short for UEFA Women\u2019s Euro 2017). More specifically, two primary interests lie in this project. The first interest lies in determining the strength of each team by assigning an Elo rating to the each competing team after tournament. In addition, it is interesting to see how home-field advantage helped the Netherlands (the host country) win the championship of UEFA Women\u2019s Euro 2017 by incorporating the home-field advantage in the Elo formula. Secondly, strengths of the players of all teams are also of interest. In order to estimate the strengths of the players, each player is assigned a rating (Not an Elo rating) to represent how strong every player is. We can then compare the players among all teams. In order to access the reliability of our ideas and methodology, a simulation study"
