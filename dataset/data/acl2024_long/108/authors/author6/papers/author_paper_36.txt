    "abstract": "Deep neural models for low-resource named 001 entity recognition (NER) have shown impres- 002 sive results by leveraging distant supervision 003 or other meta-level information (e.g. explana- 004 tion). However, the costs of acquiring such ad- 005 ditional information are generally prohibitive, 006 especially in domains where existing resources 007 (e.g. databases to be used for distant supervi- 008 sion) may not exist. In this paper, we present a 009 novel two-stage framework (A UTO T RIGG ER) 010 to improve NER performance by automati- 011 cally generating and leveraging \u201c entity triggers \u201d 012 which are essentially human-readable clues in 013 the text that can help guide the model to make 014 better decisions. Thus, the framework is able to 015 both create and leverage auxiliary supervision 016 by itself. Through experiments on three well- 017 studied NER datasets, we show that our auto- 018 matically extracted triggers are well-matched to 019 human triggers, and A UTO T RIGG ER improves 020 performance over a RoBERTa-CRF architec- 021 ture by nearly 0.5 F1 points on average and 022 much more in a low resource setting. 1 023"
