    "title": "Multilingual Multimodality: A Taxonomical Survey of Datasets, Techniques, Challenges and Opportunities",
    "abstract": "Contextualizing language technologies beyond a single language kindled embracing multiple modalities and languages. Individually, each of these directions undoubtedly proliferated into several NLP tasks. Despite this momentum, most of the multimodal research is primarily centered around English and multilingual research is primarily centered around contexts from text modality. Challenging this conventional setup, researchers studied the unification of multilingual and multimodal (MultiX) streams. The main goal of this work is to catalogue and characterize these works by charting out the categories of tasks, datasets and methods to address MultiX scenarios. To this end, we review the languages studied, gold or silver data with parallel annotations, and understand how these modalities and languages interact in modeling. We present an account of the modeling approaches along with their strengths and weaknesses to better understand what scenarios they can be used reliably. Following this, we present the high-level trends in the overall paradigm of the field. Finally, we conclude by presenting a road map of challenges and promising research directions."
