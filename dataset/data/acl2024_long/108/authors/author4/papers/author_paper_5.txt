    "title": "Will the Prince Get True Love's Kiss? On the Model Sensitivity to Gender Perturbation over Fairytale Texts",
    "abstract": "Recent studies show that traditional fairytales are rife with harmful gender biases. To help mitigate these gender biases in fairytales, this work aims to assess learned biases of language models by evaluating their robustness against gender perturbations. Specifically, we focus on Question Answering (QA) tasks in fairytales. Using counterfactual data augmentation to the FairytaleQA dataset, we evaluate model robustness against swapped gender character information, and then mitigate learned biases by introducing counterfactual gender stereotypes during training time. We additionally introduce a novel approach that utilizes the massive vocabulary of language models to support text genres beyond fairytales. Our experimental results suggest that models are sensitive to gender perturbations, with significant performance drops compared to the original testing set. However, when first fine-tuned on a counterfactual training dataset, models are less sensitive to the later introduced anti-gender stereotyped text."
