    "Title": "OceanGPT-KG: Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Reasoning for Ocean Science",
    "Idea": "OceanGPT-KG integrates a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) into the OceanGPT framework to enhance its reasoning capabilities. The KG will be constructed from oceanographic datasets, scientific literature, and expert-curated ontologies. By leveraging the KG, OceanGPT-KG can perform complex reasoning tasks such as identifying causal relationships in ocean ecosystems, predicting the impact of human activities on marine biodiversity, and generating hypotheses for new research directions. The model will use a hybrid approach, combining neural language models with symbolic reasoning over the KG, to achieve both scalability and interpretability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' (Quine’s holism) and 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions). The integration of a knowledge graph with an LLM represents a paradigm shift in how ocean science problems are approached, enabling more structured and interpretable reasoning. The hybrid approach aligns with the paper’s goal of addressing the intricate nature of ocean data.",
    "Rationale": "Knowledge graphs provide a structured way to represent and reason over complex relationships in ocean science. By integrating a KG into OceanGPT, the model can leverage both the flexibility of LLMs and the precision of symbolic reasoning. This approach has the potential to revolutionize ocean science research by enabling more accurate and interpretable predictions, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
