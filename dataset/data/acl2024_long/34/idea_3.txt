    "Title": "OceanGPT-F: Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Ocean Science",
    "Idea": "OceanGPT-F introduces a federated learning framework for OceanGPT, enabling multiple institutions to collaboratively train the model without sharing sensitive oceanographic data. Each institution will train a local model on its private data, and the models will be aggregated periodically to improve the global model. This approach ensures data privacy while allowing OceanGPT-F to benefit from diverse datasets. The model will also incorporate differential privacy techniques to further protect sensitive information.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) and 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions). The use of federated learning represents a paradigm shift in how LLMs are trained, particularly in sensitive domains like ocean science. The methodological improvement involves integrating privacy-preserving techniques into the training process.",
    "Rationale": "Data privacy is a major concern in ocean science, as much of the data is sensitive or proprietary. By using federated learning, OceanGPT-F can leverage diverse datasets while ensuring data privacy, making it a valuable tool for collaborative research. This approach has the potential to set a new standard for privacy-preserving AI in scientific research, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
