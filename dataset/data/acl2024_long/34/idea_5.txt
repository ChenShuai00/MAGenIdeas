    "Title": "OceanRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Ocean Science Knowledge Integration",
    "Idea": "OceanRAG is a novel framework that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with OceanGPT to enhance its ability to access and manipulate domain-specific knowledge. By leveraging a dense vector index of oceanographic data, OceanRAG can retrieve relevant information from external databases and generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This approach addresses the limitations of current LLMs in handling the immense and intricate nature of ocean data, providing a more granular and rich knowledge base for ocean science tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' theory (Laudan’s methodological improvement model, Hacking’s experimental system theory). The rationale is that retrieval-augmented generation has shown significant promise in improving the accuracy and credibility of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks. By adapting this method to the ocean science domain, OceanRAG can overcome the limitations of parametric memory in LLMs and provide a more robust solution for domain-specific tasks.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs struggle with the complexity and granularity of ocean data, which limits their applicability in ocean science. Retrieval-augmented generation offers a way to integrate external knowledge sources, enabling LLMs to access up-to-date and domain-specific information. This approach not only improves the accuracy of LLMs but also enhances their ability to handle complex queries and generate more informative responses.",
