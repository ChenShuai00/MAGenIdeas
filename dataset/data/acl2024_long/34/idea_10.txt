    "Title": "OceanGPT-2: A Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal LLM for Oceanographic Anomaly Detection and Explanation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes OceanGPT-2, an enhanced version of OceanGPT that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and multimodal capabilities to detect and explain anomalous oceanographic phenomena. OceanGPT-2 will leverage external knowledge bases, such as oceanographic databases and satellite imagery, to provide contextually rich and accurate explanations for anomalies like sudden temperature changes, algal blooms, or unusual marine life behavior. The model will also incorporate multimodal inputs (e.g., text, images, and sensor data) to improve its understanding of complex oceanographic events. By combining RAG with multimodal learning, OceanGPT-2 will not only detect anomalies but also generate actionable insights for oceanographers, enabling them to respond more effectively to environmental changes.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (Design and Improve Existing Methods) and **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings). The former guides the enhancement of OceanGPT's methodology by integrating RAG and multimodal learning, while the latter focuses on the model's ability to explain and integrate anomalous findings, which is critical for oceanographic research. The integration of RAG ensures that OceanGPT-2 can access up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge, while multimodal learning allows it to process diverse data types, making it more robust and versatile. This combination addresses the limitations of the original OceanGPT and opens new avenues for scientific discovery in oceanography.",
    "Rationale": "Oceanographic anomalies are often complex and require a deep understanding of multiple data sources. Current LLMs lack the ability to integrate multimodal data and external knowledge effectively, limiting their utility in this domain. OceanGPT-2 bridges this gap by combining RAG and multimodal learning, enabling it to detect and explain anomalies with greater accuracy and contextual relevance. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize oceanographic research by providing a powerful tool for anomaly detection and explanation, which is critical for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems.",
