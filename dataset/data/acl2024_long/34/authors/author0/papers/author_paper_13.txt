    "title": "Improving Knowledge Graph Representation Learning by Structure Contextual Pre-training",
    "abstract": "Representation learning models for Knowledge Graphs (KG) have proven to be effective in encoding structural information and performing reasoning over KGs. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-training-then-fine-tuning framework for knowledge graph representation learning, in which a KG model is firstly pre-trained with triple classification task, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on specific downstream tasks such as entity type prediction and entity alignment. Drawing on the general ideas of learning deep contextualized word representations in typical pre-trained language models, we propose SCoP to learn pre-trained KG representations with structural and contextual triples of the target triple encoded. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning SCoP not only outperforms results of baselines on a portfolio of downstream tasks but also avoids tedious task-specific model design and parameter training."
