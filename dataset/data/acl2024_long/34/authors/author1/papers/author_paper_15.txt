    "title": "DartGrid: a semantic infrastructure for building database Grid applications",
    "abstract": "In the presence of a Database Grid where a huge number of highly diverse, widely distributed, autonomously managed databases can be involved in a sharing cycle, database tools and middleware should be well suited for schema mediation and query processing in a semantically meaningful way. In this paper, an implemented system called DartGrid is presented. DartGrid is intended to provide a semantic infrastructure for building database grid applications. We explore the essential and fundamental roles played by Resource Description Framework (RDF) semantics for database grids and implement a set of semantically enabled tools and grid services such as semantic browser, semantic mapping tools, ontology service, semantic query service and semantic registration service. We propose an RDF\u2010View\u2010based approach for relational schema mediation and describe the view\u2010based semantic query rewriting algorithm implemented in DartGrid. DartGrid has been used to build a real database grid application for Traditional Chinese Medicine in China. Copyright \u00a9 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
