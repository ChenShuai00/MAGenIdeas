    "Title": "Cross-Lingual Transferability Index: A New Metric for Evaluating Multilingual Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes the development of a Cross-Lingual Transferability Index (CLTI), a novel metric to quantify the effectiveness of multilingual language models (MLMs) in transferring knowledge across languages, especially for low-resource languages. The CLTI would measure the ability of MLMs to generalize from high-resource to low-resource languages by evaluating their performance on a diverse set of tasks (e.g., reading comprehension, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis) across multiple language pairs. The index would be calculated based on factors such as vocabulary overlap, syntactic similarity, and task-specific performance. The goal is to provide a standardized metric that can guide the development of more effective multilingual models and highlight areas where current models fall short.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s paradigm theory and Laudan’s methodological improvement model. The CLTI addresses a gap in current evaluation metrics for multilingual models, which often focus on individual tasks or languages rather than cross-lingual transferability. By proposing a new metric, this idea aims to shift the paradigm of how multilingual models are evaluated, emphasizing the importance of transferability and inclusivity for low-resource languages.",
    "Rationale": "Current multilingual models often struggle with low-resource languages, and there is no standardized way to measure their cross-lingual transferability. The CLTI would provide a comprehensive metric that can be used to compare different models, identify weaknesses, and guide future research. This idea has the potential to significantly impact the field by promoting the development of more inclusive and effective multilingual NLP systems.",
