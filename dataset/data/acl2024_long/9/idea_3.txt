    "Title": "Multilingual Model Pretraining with Linguistic Typology",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel pretraining strategy for multilingual models that incorporates linguistic typology. The model will be pretrained on a diverse set of languages, with additional supervision based on linguistic features such as word order, morphology, and phonology. This approach aims to improve the model's ability to generalize across typologically diverse languages, especially low-resource ones.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is derived from 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' (Quine’s holism) and 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). Current pretraining strategies often ignore linguistic typology, leading to suboptimal performance in typologically diverse languages. By incorporating linguistic features into the pretraining process, we can address this limitation and improve model generalization.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale is that linguistic typology plays a crucial role in language understanding, yet it is often overlooked in multilingual model pretraining. By incorporating typological features, the model can better capture the structural diversity of languages, leading to improved performance on tasks like reading comprehension. This innovation has the potential to significantly advance the field of multilingual NLP, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
