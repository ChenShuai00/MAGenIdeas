    "abstract": "In the multi-core/multi-processor setting, each core/processor makes an independent scheduling decision. The kernel runs on a processor, and the kernel scheduler picks a process for execution. Once a process starts to run, it either runs for the entire timeslice, or does I/O and gives up its timeslice. Once this happens, the kernel runs again and picks the next process, and so on. This happens in parallel on all the processors."
