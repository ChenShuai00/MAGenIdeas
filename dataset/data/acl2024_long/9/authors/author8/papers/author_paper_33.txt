    "title": "On Unifying Misinformation Detection",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce UnifiedM2, a general-purpose misinformation model that jointly models multiple domains of misinformation with a single, unified setup. The model is trained to handle four tasks: detecting news bias, clickbait, fake news, and verifying rumors. By grouping these tasks together, UnifiedM2 learns a richer representation of misinformation, which leads to state-of-the-art or comparable performance across all tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UnifiedM2\u2019s learned representation is helpful for few-shot learning of unseen misinformation tasks/datasets and the model\u2019s generalizability to unseen events."
