    "title": "The faces of Latin American research on computational linguistics",
    "abstract": "Latin America (LatAm) is mainly represented 001 by developing or under-developed countries, 002 and given that their investment in research 003 and development may be lacking, their pres-004 ence in high-impact research communities such 005 as computational linguistics (CL) could be 006 marginal. This work aims to measure the pres-007 ence of LatAm researchers in the CL commu-008 nity and improve the visibility of those under-009 represented investigators. We extracted the 010 metadata of all ACL Anthology publications 011 with at least one LatAm researcher affiliated 012 with an institution located in an LatAm country 013 at the time of the publication. We found that 014 only a small percentage (2.4 %) of CL publica-015 tions have affiliations with institutions based in 016 LatAm and that Alexander Gelbukh (Mexico) 017 and Luciana Benotti (Argentina) are the most 018 productive researchers. Our analysis also re-019 veals that some countries in the region have not 020 contributed to any CL publications. Despite 021 these challenges, our results highlight the po-022 tential for growth and improvement. By shed-023 ding light on the underrepresentation of LatAm 024 researchers in CL, this study aims to promote 025 greater visibility and inclusivity within the com-026 munity, ultimately fostering a more diverse and 027 vibrant research landscape. 028"
