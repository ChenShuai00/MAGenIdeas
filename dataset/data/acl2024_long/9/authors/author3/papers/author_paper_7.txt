    "title": "IKER-GAITU: Research on Language Technology for Basque and Other Low-Resource Languages",
    "abstract": "The general objective of the IKER-GAITU project is to research on language technology to increase the presence of Basque in the digital environment. It will be carried out between 2023 and 2025 thanks to a grant from the Department of Culture and Language Policy of the Basque Government. Current techniques require enormous amounts of textual and oral data per language. On the other hand, the data available for Basque and other low-resource languages might not be enough to attain the same quality as larger languages with the current technology. For this reason, it is essential to research on language technology, so that low-resource languages are present with the same quality as the rest of the languages in these technologies. IKER-GAITU pursues the following research objectives: 1. A system that automatically captures the level of Basque proficiency, written and oral; 2. Bring personalized voice technology to people with disabilities; 3. Spontaneous voice transcription, both when Basque and Spanish are mixed and when there are several speakers; 4. Textual conversational systems in Basque that match the quality of the most powerful large language models. In this project summary we present the results for the first year.
