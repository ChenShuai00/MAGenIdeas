    "title": "To be a Knight-errant Novel Master: Knight-errant Style Transfer via Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Knight-errant style writing is a challenging task 001 for novice writers due to the highly condensed 002 terminology and highly literary language cul-003 ture of the knight-errant works. To tackle 004 this problem, in this paper, we propose a new 005 large-scale parallel knight-errant dataset and 006 model the knight-errant writing as a text style 007 transfer (TST) task between modern style and 008 knight-errant style. We establish the bench-009 mark performance of six current SOTA models 010 for knight-errant style transfer. Empirical re-011 sults demonstrate that the existing SOTA TST 012 models are unable to accurately identify and 013 generate knight-errant style sentences. There-014 fore, we propose Knight, a TST framework 015 based on contrastive learning. Knight uses mul-016 tiple strategies to construct positive and neg-017 ative samples, making it significantly better 018 than existing SOTA models in terms of content 019 fluency, style transfer accuracy, and factuality. 020 The data and code are publicly available 1 . 021"
