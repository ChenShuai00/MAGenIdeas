    "title": "T ailor : Generating and Perturbing Text with Semantic Controls",
    "abstract": "Making controlled perturbations is essential 001 for various tasks ( e.g., data augmentation), 002 but building task-speci\ufb01c generators can be 003 expensive. We introduce T ailor , a task-004 agnostic generation system that perturbs text 005 in a semantically-controlled way. With un-006 likelihood training, T ailor \u2019s generator is de-007 signed to follow a series of control codes de-008 rived from semantic roles. Through modi\ufb01ca-009 tions of these control codes, T ailor can pro-010 duce \ufb01ne-grained perturbations. We imple-011 ment a set of operations on control codes that 012 can be composed into complex perturbation 013 strategies, and demonstrate their e \ufb00 ectiveness 014 in three applications. First, T ailor facilitates 015 the construction of high-quality contrast sets 016 that are lexically diverse and less biased than 017 original task test data. Second, paired with au-018 tomated labeling heuristics, T ailor helps im-019 prove model generalization through data aug-020 mentation: we obtain an average gain of 1.73 021 on an (natural language inference) NLI chal-022 lenge set by perturbing just \u223c 5% of train-023 ing data. Third, without any \ufb01netuning over-024 head, T ailor \u2019s perturbations e \ufb00 ectively im-025 prove compositionality in \ufb01ne-grained style 026 transfer, outperforming \ufb01ne-tuned baselines 027 on 5 transfers. 028"
