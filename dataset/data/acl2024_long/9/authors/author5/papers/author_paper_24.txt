    "abstract": "This work presents an extensive study of 001 transformer-based NLP models, dedicated to 002 detection of social media posts containing veri-003 fiable factual claims and harmful claims. The 004 document summarizes activities carried out 005 during the pipeline execution, which led to 006 the design of the NLP models for post detec-007 tion. These activities included dataset collec-008 tion, dataset pre-processing, architecture selec-009 tion, setting up the experiments, model training 010 (fine-tuning), model testing and implementa-011 tion. Comprehensive analysis of various mod-012 els was conducted. Special attention was fo-013 cused on multilingual models, which are capa-014 ble of processing English social media posts 015 and simultaneously posts of low-resource lan-016 guages, like: Polish, Czech, Slovak and Bul-017 garian. The obtained results were validated 018 with state-of-the-art models and the compari-019 son proved the robustness of the created mod-020 els. The work\u2019s novelty consists in multi-label, 021 multilingual classification models, which can 022 efficiently perform simultaneous detection of 023 harmful posts and of social media posts con-024 taining verifiable factual claims. 025"
