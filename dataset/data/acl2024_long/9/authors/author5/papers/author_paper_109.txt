    "title": "BotsTalk: Machine-Sourced Framework for Automatic Curation of Large-scale Multi-skill Dialogue Datasets",
    "abstract": "Previous work in open-domain chatbots has 001 introduced dialogue corpora and tasks that 002 aim to inject dialogue systems different com-003 municative skills such as being personable, 004 knowledgeable and empathetic. With the ad-005 vent of conversational agents grounded to 006 specific skills, a new challenge in open-007 domain chatbots has been posed: A good 008 open-domain chatbot should retain a well-009 rounded set of skills and seamlessly blend 010 them into a conversation. To this end, a new 011 dialogue dataset Blended Skill Talk is col-012 lected via crowdsourcing and commonly used 013 as a benchmark for multi-skill dialogue gen-014 eration. However, such data construction ap-015 proach requires labor intensive manual anno-016 tation, which severely limits their utility on 017 large-scale learning. In this work, we propose 018 BotsTalk, a novel machine-sourced frame-019 work, where several agents participate in a 020 conversation to automatically annotate multi-021 skill dialogues. We then present Blended Skill 022 BotsTalk (BS B T), a large-scale multi-skill di-023 alogue dataset of 200K conversations. Exper-024 imental results show that our dataset can be 025 effectively used as training data for multi-026 skill dialogue systems which require an under-027 standing of both skill blending and grounding. 028 We also demonstrate the dataset is orthogo-029 nally applicable to diverse learning schemes 030 such as fine-tuning and multi-task learning. 031"
