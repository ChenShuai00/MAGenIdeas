    "title": "RepAL: A Simple and Plug-and-play Method for Improving Unsupervised Sentence Representations",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised sentence representation learn-001 ing is a fundamental problem in natural lan-002 guage processing and has been studied exten-003 sively in recent years. This paper presents 004 Rep resentation AL chemy (RepAL), an ex-005 tremely simple post-processing method that 006 enhances unsupervised sentence representa-007 tions. The basic idea in RepAL is to ex-008 tract redundant information from the repre-009 sentation of a sentence generated by the ex-010 isting models and then re\ufb01ne the representa-011 tion through an embedding re\ufb01nement opera-012 tion to \ufb01lter such redundant information. In 013 this paper, we analyze the redundant infor-014 mation from two levels: sentence-level and 015 corpus-level, and the theoretical analysis for 016 the latter is also conducted. We point out 017 that RepAL is free of training and is a plug-018 and-play method that can be combined with 019 most existing unsupervised sentence learning 020 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate 021 RepAL\u2019s effectiveness and show that RepAL 022 is a model-agnostic method for unsupervised 023 sentence embedding enhancement. Besides, 024 we also designed detailed ablation studies to 025 understand why RepAL works and provided 026 in-depth analysis and understanding of the re-027 dundant information. 028"
