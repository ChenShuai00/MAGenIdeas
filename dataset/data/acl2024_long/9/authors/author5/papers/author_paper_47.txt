    "title": "A Distilled Representation for Zero and Few-Shot Localization of Task-Oriented Dialogue Agents",
    "abstract": "Task-oriented Dialogue (ToD) agents are 001 mostly limited to a few widely-spoken lan-002 guages, mainly due to the high cost of acquir-003 ing training data for each language. Existing 004 low-cost approaches that rely on cross-lingual 005 embeddings or naive machine translation sac-006 ri\ufb01ce a lot of accuracy for data ef\ufb01ciency, and 007 largely fail in creating a usable dialogue agent. 008 We propose automatic methods that use ToD 009 training data in a source language to build a 010 high-quality functioning dialogue agent in an-011 other target language that has no training data 012 (i.e. zero-shot) or a small training set (i.e. few-013 shot). Unlike most prior work in cross-lingual 014 ToD that only focus on Dialogue State Track-015 ing (DST), we build an end-to-end agent. 016 We show that our approach closes the accu-017 racy gap between few-shot and existing full-018 shot methods for ToD agents. We achieve 019 this by (1) improving the dialogue data repre-020 sentation, (2) improving entity-aware machine 021 translation, and (3) automatic \ufb01ltering of noisy 022 translations. 023 We evaluate our approach on the recent bilin-024 gual dialogue dataset BiToD. In Chinese to 025 English transfer, in the zero-shot setting, our 026 method achieves 46.7% and 22.0% in Task 027 Success Rate (TSR) and Dialogue Success 028 Rate (DSR) respectively. In the few-shot set-029 ting where 10% of the data in the target lan-030 guage is used, we improve the state-of-the-art 031 by 15.2% and 14.0%, coming within 5% of 032 full-shot training. 1 033"
