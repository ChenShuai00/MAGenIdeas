    "title": "Emotion Style Transfer with a Speci\ufb01ed Intensity Using Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Text style transfer is a widely explored task 001 in natural language generation which aims to 002 change the stylistic properties of the text while 003 retaining its style-independent content. In this 004 work, we propose the task of emotion style 005 transfer with a speci\ufb01ed intensity in an un-006 supervised setting. The aim is to rewrite a 007 given sentence, in any emotion, to a target 008 emotion while also controlling the intensity 009 of the target emotion. Emotions are gradi-010 ent in nature, some words/phrases represent 011 higher emotional intensity, while others repre-012 sent lower intensity. In this task, we want to 013 control this gradient nature of the emotion in 014 the output. Additionally, we explore the issues 015 with the existing datasets and address them. A 016 novel BART-based model is proposed that is 017 trained for the task by direct rewards. Unlike 018 existing work, we bootstrap the BART model 019 by training it to generate paraphrases so that 020 it can explore lexical and syntactic diversity 021 required for the output. Extensive automatic 022 and human evaluations show the ef\ufb01cacy of 023 our model in solving the problem. 024"
