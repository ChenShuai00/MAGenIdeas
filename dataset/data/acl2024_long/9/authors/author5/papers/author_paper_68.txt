    "abstract": "Studies have shown that both the syntactic 001 structures and words\u2019 semantics are impor-002 tant for sentence matching. Existing stud-003 ies usually model the syntactic structures and 004 word semantics separately, resulting in match-005 ing models that overlook the relations and de-006 pendencies between syntactic structures and 007 semantic meanings. How to jointly model 008 the syntactic and semantic information has 009 become a challenging problem in sentence 010 matching. To address the issue, we formal-011 ize sentence matching as a problem of as-012 signing the word of one sentence to that of 013 another sentence, with the costs determined 014 by the differences between the correspond-015 ing syntactic structures and word embedding 016 similarities. The proposed method, referred 017 to as neural quadratic assignment program-018 ming for sentence matching (NQAP-SM), rep-019 resents the syntactic structures and semantic 020 matching signals as an association graph. Solv-021 ing the relaxed quadratic assignment program-022 ming (QAP) on this association graph achieves 023 the \ufb01nal matching score. Experimental re-024 sults on three public datasets demonstrated 025 that NQAP-SM can outperform the state-of-026 the-art baselines in an effective and ef\ufb01cient 027 way. The analysis also showed that NQAP-SM 028 can match sentences in an interpretable way. 029"
