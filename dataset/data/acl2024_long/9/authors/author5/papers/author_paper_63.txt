    "title": "Evaluating the Projectivity of Presupposition Triggers in Various Entailment-Canceling Environments",
    "abstract": "Previous studies investigate the ability of mod-001 els to make pragmatic inferences using pre-002 supposition triggers. However, although pro-003 jection of presuppositions can vary depending 004 on the combination of triggers and environ-005 ments, they evaluate the performance of mod-006 els without human baseline, or include only 007 negative sentences as entailment-canceling en-008 vironments. To evaluate inferences with pre-009 supposition triggers, it is necessary to solicit 010 human judgments as a baseline for model eval-011 uation and use various types of entailment-012 canceling environments. In this study, we in-013 troduce a template-based natural language in-014 ference dataset called Projectivity of Presup-015 position Triggers (PPT), which includes 9,800 016 sentence pairs crossed with six types of pre-017 supposition triggers and four types of syntactic 018 environments. Analysing judgements from 283 019 people on a subset of the dataset, we find that 020 humans take most presupposition patterns as 021 projective, but the projectivity varies depend-022 ing on the combination of triggers and envi-023 ronments. In contrast, models judge some pat-024 terns as non-projective, indicating that the abil-025 ity of the models to process presuppositions 026 may not be human-like. This result highlights 027 that researchers working on model evaluation 028 and dataset creation need to take extra care of 029 the combination of presupposition triggers and 030 environments where they are embedded. 031"
