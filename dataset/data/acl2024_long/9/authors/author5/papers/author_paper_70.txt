    "title": "XLTime: A Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer Framework for Zero-Shot Low-Resource Language Temporal Expression Extraction",
    "abstract": "Temporal Expression Extraction (TEE) is es-001 sential for understanding time in natural lan-002 guage. It has applications in Natural Lan-003 guage Processing (NLP) tasks such as question 004 answering, information retrieval, and causal 005 inference. To date, work in this area has 006 mostly focused on English as TEE for low-007 resource languages is hindered by a scarcity 008 of training data. We propose XLTime, a 009 novel framework for zero-shot low-resource 010 language TEE. XLTime works on top of pre-011 trained language models and leverages multi-012 task learning to prompt cross-language knowl-013 edge transfer both from English and within the 014 low-resource languages. It alleviates the prob-015 lems caused by the shortage in low-resource 016 language training data. We apply XLTime 017 with different language models and show that 018 it outperforms the previous automatic SOTA 019 methods on four low-resource languages, i.e., 020 French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Basque, by 021 large margins. It also closes the gap consider-022 ably on the handcrafted HeidelTime tool. 023"
