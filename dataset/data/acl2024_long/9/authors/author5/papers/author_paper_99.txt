    "abstract": "Explainable arti\ufb01cial intelligence with natural 001 language explanations (Natural-XAI) aims to 002 produce human-readable explanations as evi-003 dence for AI decision-making. This evidence 004 can enhance human trust and understanding of 005 AI systems and contribute to AI explainabil-006 ity and transparency. However, the current ap-007 proaches focus on single explanation genera-008 tion only. In this paper, we conduct experi-009 ments with the state-of-the-art Transformer ar-010 chitecture and explore multiple explanations 011 generation using a public benchmark dataset, 012 e-SNLI (Camburu et al., 2018). We propose 013 a novel deep generative Natural-XAI frame-014 work: INITIATIVE , standing for expla I n 015 a N d pred I c T w I th contextu A l condi TI onal 016 V ariational auto E ncoder for generating natu-017 ral language explanations and making a pre-018 diction at the same time. Our method achieves 019 competitive or better performance against the 020 state-of-the-art baseline models on generation 021 (4.7% improvement in the BLEU score) and 022 prediction (4.4% improvement in accuracy) 023 tasks. Our work can serve as a solid deep gen-024 erative model baseline for future Natural-XAI 025 research. Our code will be publicly available 026 on GitHub upon paper acceptance. 027"
