    "abstract": "Cross-lingual natural language inference is 001 a fundamental problem in cross-lingual lan-002 guage understanding. Many recent works 003 have used prompt learning to address the lack 004 of annotated parallel corpora in XNLI. How-005 ever, these methods adopt discrete prompting 006 by simply translating the template to the tar-007 get language and need external expert knowl-008 edge to design the templates. Besides, dis-009 crete prompts of human-designed template 010 words are not trainable vectors which can 011 be migrated to target languages in the infer-012 ence stage \ufb02exibly. In this paper, we pro-013 pose a novel Soft prompt learning frame-014 work enhanced by L anguage-IN dependent 015 K nowledge (SoftLINK) for XNLI. SoftLINK 016 \ufb01rst constructs cloze-style question with soft 017 prompts for the input sample. Then we lever-018 age bilingual dictionaries to generate an aug-019 mented multilingual question for the original 020 question. SoftLINK also adopts a multilingual 021 verbalizer to align the representations of origi-022 nal and augmented multilingual questions on 023 the semantic space with consistency regular-024 ization. Experimental results on XNLI demon-025 strate that SoftLINK can achieve state-of-the-026 art performance and signi\ufb01cantly outperform 027 the previous methods under the few-shot and 028 full-shot cross-lingual transfer settings. 029"
