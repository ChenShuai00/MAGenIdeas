    "title": "D 4 : A Psychiatrist-proofread Dialogue Dataset for Depression Diagnosis",
    "abstract": "Depression has affected large populations and 001 become a signi\ufb01cant threat to life expecta-002 tions globally. Automatic depression diagno-003 sis methods have been a new research focus. 004 In particular, automatic dialogue-based diag-005 nosis systems are desired since depression di-006 agnosis highly relies on clinical consultation. 007 Based on clinical diagnosis criteria, doctors 008 initiate a conversation with ample emotional 009 support that guides the patients to expose their 010 symptoms. Such a dialog is a combination of 011 task-oriented and chitchat, different from tra-012 ditional single-purpose human-machine dialog 013 systems. However, due to the social stigma as-014 sociated with mental illness, the dialogue data 015 related to the diagnosis of actual patients are 016 rarely disclosed. The lack of data has become 017 one of the major factors restricting the research 018 on the consultation dialogue system of depres-019 sion. Based on clinical depression diagnos-020 tic criteria ICD-11 and DSM-5, we construct 021 a Psychiatrist-proofread Dialogue Dataset for 022 Depression Diagnosis which simulates the di-023 alogue between the doctor and the patient dur-024 ing the diagnosis of depression and provides 025 diagnosis results and symptom summary given 026 by professional psychiatrists for each dialogue. 027 Finally, we \ufb01netune on state-of-art pre-training 028 models and respectively give our dataset base-029 lines on response generation, topic prediction, 030 dialog summary, and severity classi\ufb01cation of 031 depression and suicide risk. 032"
