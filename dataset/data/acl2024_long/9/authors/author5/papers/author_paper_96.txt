    "abstract": "Massive false rumors emerging along with 001 breaking news or trending topics severely hin-002 der the truth. Exiting rumor detection ap-003 proaches achieve promising performance on 004 the yesterday\u2019s news, since there is enough 005 corpus collected from the same domain for 006 model training. However, they are poor at de-007 tecting rumors about unforeseen events such 008 as COVID-19 due to the lack of training data 009 and prior knowledge (i.e., low-resource ru-010 mors). In this paper, we propose an adver-011 sarial contrastive learning framework to de-012 tect low-resource rumors by adapting the fea-013 tures learned from well-resourced rumor data 014 to that of the low-resourced. Our model ex-015 plicitly overcomes the restriction of both do-016 main and language usage via language align-017 ment and contrastive training. Moreover, we 018 develop an adversarial augmentation mech-019 anism to further enhance the robustness of 020 low-resource rumor representation. Extensive 021 experiments conducted on two low-resource 022 datasets collected from real-world microblog 023 platforms demonstrate that our framework 024 achieves much better performance than state-025 of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior ca-026 pacity for detecting rumors at early stages. 027"
