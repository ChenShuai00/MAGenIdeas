    "abstract": "Personality traits in\ufb02uence human actions and 001 thoughts, which is manifested in day to day 002 conversations. Although glimpses of person-003 ality traits are observable in existing open do-004 main conversation corpora, leveraging generic 005 language modelling for response generation 006 overlooks the interlocutor idiosyncrasies, re-007 sulting in non-customizable personality agnos-008 tic responses. With the motivation of enabling 009 con\ufb01gurable response generators, in this paper 010 we experiment with ways to ground neural re-011 sponse generators based on both (i) interlocu-012 tor Big-5 personality traits, and (ii) discourse 013 intent as control codes, training an end-to-end 014 dialogue agent that can not only leverage the 015 control codes as policy for nuanced response 016 generation, but also predict and decide the gen-017 eration policy to be utilized by the generator. 018 Since most of the existing large scale open do-019 main chat corpora do not include Big-5 person-020 ality traits and discourse intent, we employ au-021 tomatic annotation schemes to enrich the cor-022 pora with policy consisting of noisy estimates 023 of these features as control codes, and lever-024 age automatic evaluation metrics along with 025 ablation studies, to assess the impact of us-026 ing control codes for response generation. Ad-027 ditionally, we leverage human judgement to 028 demonstrate the effectiveness of using such 029 personality and pragmatics based policy for re-030 sponse generation. Our experiments illustrate 031 the effectiveness of this strategy resulting in 032 improvements to existing benchmarks. 033"
