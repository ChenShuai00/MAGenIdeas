    "abstract": "Personalized response selection systems are 001 generally grounded on persona . However, the 002 angle of emotion in\ufb02uencing response selec-003 tion is not explored. Also, faithfulness to the 004 conversation context of these systems plunges 005 when a contradictory or an off-topic response 006 is selected. This paper makes an attempt to 007 address these issues by proposing a suite of 008 fusion strategies that capture the interaction 009 between persona, emotion, and entailment in-010 formation of the utterances. A concept-\ufb02ow 011 encoder is designed which capture the rele-012 vant concept knowledge both in context and 013 responses. Ablation studies were done on 014 Persona-Chat dataset show that incorpo-015 rating emotion, entailment improves the accu-016 racy of response selection. We combine our 017 fusion strategies and concept-\ufb02ow encoding to 018 train a BERT based model which outperforms 019 the previous methods by margins larger than 020 1.9% on original personas and 1.7% on revised 021 personas in terms of hits@1 (top-1 accuracy), 022 achieving a new state-of-the-art performance 023 on the Persona-Chat dataset. 024"
