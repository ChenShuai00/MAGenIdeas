    "abstract": "Data augmentation is commonly used in train-001 ing in low-resource scenarios. However, there 002 are sometimes large discrepancy between dis-003 tributions of augmented data and target data. 004 How to bridge the gap between the augmented 005 and target data, especially when target data is 006 harder-to-learn? In this paper, we study im-007 proved data augmentation strategies in the sce-008 nario of scienti\ufb01c slides text summarization, 009 where we generate a textual summary based 010 on texts of presentation slides. Since slides are 011 messy and dif\ufb01cult to understand by current 012 models, we introduce an easier form of data, 013 i.e., articles in natural language. The basic 014 idea is that we generate the transition data be-015 tween slides and articles, and all three of them 016 form a curriculum for neural models to learn 017 the distribution transition from article data to 018 slides data. We \ufb01nd that our approach achieves 019 consistent improvements over different back-020 bone summarization models. The curriculum-021 oriented data augmentation method can gener-022 ate data that \ufb01ll the gap between the easy-to-023 obtain data and the low-resource task data. We 024 show that curriculum learning and data aug-025 mentation can be combined to help NLP mod-026 els learn from otherwise hard-to-learn data. 1 027"
