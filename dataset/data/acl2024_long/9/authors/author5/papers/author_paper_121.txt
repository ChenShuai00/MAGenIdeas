    "title": "Exploiting Dialogue Act for Knowledge Selection and Response Generation",
    "abstract": "Dialogue act (DA) is the description of the in-001 tention or function of a dialogue utterance. In 002 document-grounded dialogue, correctly under-003 standing the dialogue context is crucial for mod-004 els to select knowledge and inject knowledge 005 into responses. Leveraging dialogue act can 006 help to understand the dialogue context and 007 consequently assist the utilization of document 008 information. In this paper, we propose a novel 009 framework leveraging two different kinds of 010 DAs (model-annotated and human-annotated) 011 for Knowledge Selection (KS) and Response 012 Generation (RG). The framework consists of 013 two modules: the prediction module is trained 014 with multi-task learning and learns to select 015 knowledge and predict the next DA; the gen-016 eration module uses the selected knowledge 017 and the predicted DA for the RG. Our model 018 achieves new state-of-the-art performance on 019 three public datasets and the results verify that 020 leveraging DA can help KS and RG. Our code 021 and data will be released on github.com. 022"
