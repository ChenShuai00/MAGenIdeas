    "title": "Question-Answer Driven Semantic Role Labeling: Using Natural Language to Annotate Natural Language",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces the task of questionanswer driven semantic role labeling (QA-SRL), where question-answer pairs are used to represent predicate-argument structure. For example, the verb \u201cintroduce\u201d in the previous sentence would be labeled with the questions \u201cWhat is introduced?\u201d, and \u201cWhat introduces something?\u201d, each paired with the phrase from the sentence that gives the correct answer. Posing the problem this way allows the questions themselves to define the set of possible roles, without the need for predefined frame or thematic role ontologies. It also allows for scalable data collection by annotators with very little training and no linguistic expertise. We gather data in two domains, newswire text and Wikipedia articles, and introduce simple classifierbased models for predicting which questions to ask and what their answers should be. Our results show that non-expert annotators can produce high quality QA-SRL data, and also establish baseline performance levels for future work on this task."
