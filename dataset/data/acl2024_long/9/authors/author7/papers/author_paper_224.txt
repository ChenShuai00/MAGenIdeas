    "title": "CSE 517 : Natural Language Processing New Quals Course !",
    "abstract": "The syllabus is subject to change; always get the latest version from the class website. Natural language processing (NLP) seeks to endow computers with the ability to intelligently process human language. NLP components are used in conversational agents and other systems that engage in dialogue with humans, automatic translation between human languages, automatic answering of questions using large text collections, the extraction of structured information from text, tools that help human authors, and many, many more. This course will teach you the fundamental ideas used in key NLP components. It is organized into four parts: 1. Probabilistic language models, which define probability distributions over text passages. 2. Text classifiers, which infer attributes of a piece of text by \" reading \" it. 3. Analyzers, which map texts into linguistic representations that in turn enable various kinds of understanding. 4. Generators, which produce natural language as output. Table 1 shows the planned lectures, along with readings. Participation points are earned by submitting proposed oral exam questions. You are expected to submit one per week, between Monday at 1:30 pm and Friday at 5:00 pm, through the appropriate catalyst link for each week: 1/4\u20138; 1/11\u201315; the rest are through the canvas site for this course."
