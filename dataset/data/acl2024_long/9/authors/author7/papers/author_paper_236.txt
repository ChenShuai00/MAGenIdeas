    "title": "Learning to Parse Natural Language to a Robot Execution System",
    "abstract": "The ability to interpret, or ground , natural language commands so they can be executed by a robot is important for enabling untrained users to interact with robots. Logic-based formal representations have been applied very successfully to robots\u2019 world and action models taking perceptual and grounding uncertainty into account; however, these approaches have historically either used formal target representations with severely limited expressiveness or written the formal representations manually rather than learning them. As a consequence, they are not able to parse previously unseen NL commands to more complex robot control systems. In this paper, we investigate how recently developed parser learning techniques can be applied to mapping natural language commands to a formal representation expressive enough for modeling robot control systems. Speci\ufb01cally, we aim to learn a parser mapping natural language indoor route instructions into a LISP-like control language. We test our approach using a simulator executing RCL programs on sets of natural language route instructions given by non-experts."
