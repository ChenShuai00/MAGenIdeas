    "title": "Crowdsourcing a High-Quality Gold Standard for QA-SRL",
    "abstract": "Question-answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) has been proposed as an attractive open and natural form of SRL, easily crowdsourceable for new corpora. Recently, a large-scale QA-SRL corpus and a trained parser were released, accompanied by a densely annotated dataset for evaluation. Trying to replicate the QA-SRL annotation and evaluation scheme for new texts, we observed that the resulting annotations were lacking in quality and coverage, particularly insufficient for creating gold standards for evaluation. In this paper, we present an improved QA-SRL annotation protocol, involving crowd-worker selection and training, followed by data consolidation. Applying this process, we release a new gold evaluation dataset for QA-SRL, yielding more consistent annotations and greater coverage. We believe that our new annotation protocol and gold standard will facilitate future replicable research of natural semantic annotations."
