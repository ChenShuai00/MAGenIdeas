    "title": "Learning Probabilistic Relational Planning Rules",
    "abstract": "To learn to behave in highly complex domains, agents must represent and learn compact models of the world dynamics. In this paper, we present an algorithm for learning probabilistic STRIPS-like planning operators from examples. We demonstrate the effective learning of rule-based operators for a wide range of traditional planning domains."
