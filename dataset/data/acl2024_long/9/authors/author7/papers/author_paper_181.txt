    "title": "Globally Coherent Text Generation with Neural Checklist Models",
    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks can generate locally coherent text but often have dif\ufb01culties representing what has already been generated and what still needs to be said \u2013 especially when constructing long texts. We present the neural checklist model , a recurrent neural network that models global coherence by storing and updating an agenda of text strings which should be mentioned somewhere in the output. The model generates output by dynamically adjusting the interpolation among a language model and a pair of attention models that encourage references to agenda items. Evaluations on cooking recipes and dialogue system responses demonstrate high coherence with greatly improved semantic coverage of the agenda."
