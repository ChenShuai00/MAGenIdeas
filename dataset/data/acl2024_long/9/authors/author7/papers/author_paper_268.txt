    "title": "Explanatory lifelike avatars: performing user-centered tasks in 3D learning environments",
    "abstract": "Because of their multimodal communicative abilities and strong visual presence, animated pedagogical agents offer significant promise for 3D learning environments. We describe a new class of animated pedagogical agents, explanatory lifelike avatars, which can perform user-designed tasks in rich 3D worlds. By generating task networks to perform student-designed tasks, an avatar task planner constructs and interprets action specifications that it then interprets within the geometries of the 3D environment to generate navigational, manipulative, and verbal behaviors. Filmed by a narrative camera planner in the 3D world, the avatars perform students\u2019 tasks and accompanies them with running verbal explanations in realtime. The explanatory lifelike avatar framework has been implemented in a full-scale avatar for the CPU CITY learning environment, a 3D learning environment for the domain of computer architecture and systems for novices. To investigate the effectiveness of this approach, a novel four-way comparative usability study was conducted with an \u201cagentless\u201d world, a disembodied narrator, a mute lifelike avatar, and a fullscale explanatory avatar. Results of the study suggest that explanatory lifelike avatars hold much promise for learning environments."
