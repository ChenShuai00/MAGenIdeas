    "title": "Task-sensitive cinematography interfaces for interactive 3D learning environments",
    "abstract": "Interactive 3D learning environments can provide rich problemsolving experiences with unparalleled visual impact. In these environments, students interactively solve problems by directing their avatars to navigate through complex worlds, transport entities from one location to another, and manipulate devices. However, realtime camera control is critical to their successful deployment. To create effective learning experiences, a virtual camera must in realtime \u201cfilm\u201d their activities in a manner that most clearly depicts the salient aspects of the tasks students are performing. To address this problem, we have developed the cinematic task modeling framework for automated realtime task-sensitive camera control in 3D environments. Cinematic task models dynamically map the intentional structure of users\u2019 activities to visual structures that continuously depict the most relevant actions and objects in the environment. By exploiting cinematic task models, a cinematography interface to 3D learning environments can dynamically plan camera positions, view directions, and camera movements that help users perform their tasks. To investigate the effect of the cinematic task modeling framework on student-environment interactions, we have constructed a fullscale cinematography interface and a 3D learning environment testbed. Focus group studies suggest that task-sensitive camera planning significantly improves students\u2019 interactions with complex 3D learning environments."
