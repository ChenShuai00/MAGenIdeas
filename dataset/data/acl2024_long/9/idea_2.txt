    "Title": "Unified Multilingual Evaluation Framework: Beyond Language-Specific Benchmarks",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a unified evaluation framework for multilingual models that goes beyond language-specific benchmarks. The framework will incorporate cross-lingual transferability, cultural adaptability, and robustness to linguistic diversity, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance across all 122 languages in the Belebele dataset.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on 'Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies' (Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory) and 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions). Current evaluation frameworks are often limited to specific languages or tasks, failing to capture the full capabilities of multilingual models. By proposing a unified framework, we can address this gap and set a new standard for multilingual model evaluation.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale is that a unified evaluation framework is essential for advancing the field of multilingual NLP. By providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance across diverse languages and tasks, this framework can drive innovation and improve the generalizability of multilingual models. This idea has the potential to significantly impact the field, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
