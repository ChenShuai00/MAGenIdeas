    "title": "Justifying Recommendations using Distantly-Labeled Reviews and Fine-Grained Aspects",
    "abstract": "Several recent works have considered the problem of generating reviews (or \u2018tips\u2019) as a form of explanation as to why a recommendation might match a customer\u2019s interests. While promising, we demonstrate that existing approaches struggle (in terms of both quality and content) to generate justifications that are relevant to users\u2019 decision-making process. We seek to introduce new datasets and methods to address the recommendation justification task. In terms of data, we first propose an \u2018extractive\u2019 approach to identify review segments which justify users\u2019 intentions; this approach is then used to distantly label massive review corpora and construct large-scale personalized recommendation justification datasets. In terms of generation, we are able to design two personalized generation models with this data: (1) a reference-based Seq2Seq model with aspect-planning which can generate justifications covering different aspects, and (2) an aspect-conditional masked language model which can generate diverse justifications based on templates extracted from justification histories. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets which show that our model is capable of generating convincing and diverse justifications."
