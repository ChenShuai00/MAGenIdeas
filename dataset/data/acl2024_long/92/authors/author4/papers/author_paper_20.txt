    "title": "A New Benchmark of Graph Learning for PM2.5 Forecasting under Distribution Shift",
    "abstract": "We present a new benchmark task for graph-based machine learning, aiming to predict future air quality (PM2.5 concentration) observed by a geographically distributed network of environmental sensors. While prior work has successfully applied Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on a wide family of spatio-temporal prediction tasks, the new benchmark task introduced here brings a technical challenge that has been less studied in the context of graph-based spatio-temporal learning: distribution shift across a long period of time. An important goal of this paper is to understand the behaviour of spatio-temporal GNNs under distribution shift. To achieve this goal, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of both graph-based and non-graph-based machine learning models on the proposed benchmark task. To single out the influence of distribution shift on the model performances, we design two data split settings for control experiments. The first setting splits the data naturally by the order of time, while the second setting assigns all the time stamps randomly into training, validation, and test sets, which removes the effect of distribution shift. Our empirical results suggest that GNN models tend to suffer more from distribution shift compared to non-graph-based models, which calls for special attention when deploying spatio-temporal GNNs in practice."
