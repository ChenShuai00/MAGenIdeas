    "abstract": "Objective: To detect the expression levels of cytokines secreted by immune cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to investigate their correlation with clinical indicators, and in order to provide new for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods: 106 cases of CHB, 96 cases of LC, 21 cases of HCC from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020, in the third people\u2019s Hospital of Kunming. The changes of liver function indexes such as ALT, AST, TBIL, IBIL and DBIL were detected by automatic biochemical analyzer. The expression of cytokines IL-1 \u03b2 , IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12P70, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1 , IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1 in peripheral blood was detected by multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence assay. And the correlation between the above liver function indexes and cytokines was analyzed. As comparison, 100 healthy people served as normal control group. Results: The expressions of AST, ALT, TBIL, DBIL and IBIL in CHB, LC and HCC groups were higher than normal control group. Excepted IL-5, IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6, the expression of IL-2, IL-1 \u03b2 , IFN-\u03b3 , IL-8, IL-17, IL-12P70 and TNF-\u03b1 in CHB, LC and HCC group was significantly higher than normal control group ( P < 0.05), while the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 was significantly lower than normal control group ( P < 0.05). There were significant differences in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-4 among CHB, LC and HCC groups ( P < 0.05). Cytokines IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly correlated with AST, ALT, TBIL, DBIL and IBIL ( P < 0.05). Conclusion: The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 \u03b2 , IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12P70, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1 , IFN-\u03b3 , IFN-\u03b1 ) increased, while the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) decreased in CHB, LC and HCC. The liver damage caused by inflammatory immune reaction was increase led to the deterioration of the disease"
