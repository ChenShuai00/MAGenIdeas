    "abstract": "Background As an unconventional subpopulation of T lymphocytes, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can recognize antigens independently of major histocompatibility complex restrictions. Recent studies have indicated that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells play contrasting roles in tumor microenvironments\u2014promoting tumor progression in some cancers (eg, gallbladder and leukemia) while suppressing it in others (eg, lung and gastric). \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are mainly enriched in peripheral mucosal tissues. As the cervix is a mucosa-rich tissue, the role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in cervical cancer warrants further investigation. Methods We employed a multiomics strategy that integrated abundant data from single-cell and bulk transcriptome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, genotyping array, immunohistochemistry, and MRI. Results Heterogeneity was observed in the level of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell infiltration in cervical cancer tissues, mainly associated with the tumor somatic mutational landscape. Definitely, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells play a beneficial role in the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer. First, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells exert direct cytotoxic effects in the tumor microenvironment of cervical cancer through the dynamic evolution of cellular states at both poles. Second, higher levels of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell infiltration also shape the microenvironment of immune activation with cancer-suppressive properties. We found that these intricate features can be observed by MRI-based radiomics models to non-invasively assess \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell proportions in tumor tissues in patients. Importantly, patients with high infiltration levels of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may be more amenable to immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies, than to chemoradiotherapy. Conclusions \u03b3\u03b4 T cells play a beneficial role in antitumor immunity in cervical cancer. The abundance of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in cervical cancerous tissue is associated with higher response rates to immunotherapy."
