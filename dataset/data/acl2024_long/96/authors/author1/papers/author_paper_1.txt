    "abstract": "This study investigated the efficacy and safety of toripalimab in combination with concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation in patients with untreated locally advanced cervical cancer. Eligible patients received toripalimab 240\u2009mg once every 3\u2009weeks in combination with concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, followed by the maintenance of toripalimab once every 6\u2009weeks up to 1\u2009year. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included 2-year and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates, 3-year overall survival (OS) rate, and safety. Biomarker analysis of PD-L1 expression and genomic mutational analysis by next-generation sequencing were conducted, as well as PD-L1 expression on tumor biopsies. A total of 82 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up was 21\u2009months (range, 5.2-44.5\u2009months). The ORR and disease control rate were both 87.8% among the 82 patients. Median PFS and OS were not reached. A trend toward longer PFS was observed in the populations with a PD-L1 combined positive score\u2009\u226510, low tumor mutation burden and loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigen (HLA LOH) detected populations. A total of 37 patients experienced treatment-related adverse events, of which 17 (20.7%) patients experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events. Collectively, toripalimab plus concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy showed promising antitumor efficacy with acceptable safety profiles in patients with untreated locally advanced cervical cancer."
