    "Title": "QuantDistill: Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation for Ultra-Low Precision LLMs",
    "Idea": "QuantDistill proposes a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework where multiple high-precision teacher models with diverse architectures are used to guide the training of a single ultra-low precision student model. Each teacher model provides complementary knowledge, allowing the student to learn a more robust and generalized representation. The framework also introduces a novel attention-based distillation mechanism that dynamically weights the contributions of each teacher based on the input context, ensuring that the student model benefits from the most relevant knowledge at each step.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving) and 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' (Kitcher’s unified theory of science). The hypothesis is that leveraging multiple teachers with diverse architectures can provide a richer and more diverse knowledge base for the student model, leading to better generalization and performance. The attention-based distillation mechanism is a creative extension of existing distillation techniques.",
    "Rationale": "Traditional knowledge distillation methods rely on a single teacher model, which may not capture the full complexity of the task. By using multiple teachers, QuantDistill can provide a more comprehensive learning experience for the student model, particularly in ultra-low precision settings where the student model’s capacity is limited. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of sub-4-bit LLMs on complex tasks.",
