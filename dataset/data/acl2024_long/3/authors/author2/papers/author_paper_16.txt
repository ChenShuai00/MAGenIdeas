    "abstract": "Web search engines deploy large-scale selection services on CPUs to identify a set of web pages that match user queries. An FPGA-based accelerator can exploit various levels of parallelism and provide a lower latency, higher throughput, more energy-efficient solution than commodity CPUs. However, maintaining such a customized accelerator in a commercial search engine is challenging because selection services are changed often. This article presents our design for FlexSaaS (Flexible Selection as a Service), an FPGA-based accelerator for web search selection. To address efficiency and flexibility challenges, FlexSaaS abstracts computing models and separates memory access from computation. Specifically, FlexSaaS (i) contains a reconfigurable number of matching processors that can handle various possible query plans, (ii) decouples index stream reading from matching computation to fetch and decode index files, and (iii) includes a universal memory accessor that hides the complex memory hierarchy and reduces host data access latency. Evaluated on FPGAs in the selection service of a commercial web search--the Bing web search engine\u2014FlexSaaS can be evolved quickly to adapt to new updates. Compared to the software baseline, FlexSaaS on Arria 10 reduces average latency by 30% and increases throughput by 1.5\u00d7."
