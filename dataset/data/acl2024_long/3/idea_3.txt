    "Title": "BitEvolve: Evolutionary Optimization for Ultra-Low Bit LLMs",
    "Idea": "BitEvolve employs evolutionary algorithms to optimize the quantization process for ultra-low bit LLMs. The framework uses a population-based approach to explore different quantization configurations, including bit-width, clipping range, and scaling factors. The evolutionary algorithm is guided by a fitness function that balances model accuracy and computational efficiency. BitEvolve also introduces a novel mutation operator that adapts the quantization parameters based on the model's performance during training.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' theory, particularly Kuhnâ€™s theory of scientific revolutions, which emphasizes the development of new conceptual frameworks. The 'Propose New Hypotheses' theory, specifically intuition and creative leaps, is also used to hypothesize that evolutionary optimization can lead to more efficient quantization strategies.",
    "Rationale": "Evolutionary algorithms are well-suited for exploring complex optimization landscapes, making them ideal for finding optimal quantization configurations. By leveraging evolutionary optimization, BitEvolve can discover novel quantization strategies that outperform traditional methods, particularly in ultra-low bit regimes.",
