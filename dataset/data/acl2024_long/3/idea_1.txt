    "Title": "QuantDistill: Cross-Modality Knowledge Distillation for Multi-Bit LLMs",
    "Idea": "QuantDistill proposes a cross-modality knowledge distillation framework where a high-precision teacher model trained on one modality (e.g., text) distills knowledge into a low-precision student model trained on another modality (e.g., audio or vision). This approach leverages the complementary strengths of different modalities to enhance the performance of multi-bit LLMs. The framework introduces a novel modality alignment loss that ensures the student model effectively captures the teacher's knowledge across modalities, even at ultra-low precisions.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in the 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' theory, particularly Kitcherâ€™s unified theory of science, which advocates for interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks. The 'Propose New Hypotheses' theory, specifically analogical reasoning, is also used to hypothesize that cross-modality distillation can improve the robustness of multi-bit LLMs.",
    "Rationale": "Multi-modality learning is a growing area of interest, and combining it with quantization can lead to more efficient and versatile models. By distilling knowledge across modalities, QuantDistill can improve the generalization capabilities of low-precision LLMs, making them more effective in multi-modal tasks such as audio-visual understanding or text-to-image generation.",
