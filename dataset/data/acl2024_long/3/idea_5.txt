    "Title": "BitFusion: Dynamic Precision Adaptation for Sub-4-Bit LLMs",
    "Idea": "BitFusion introduces a novel framework that dynamically adapts the precision of LLM weights and activations during inference based on the complexity of the input task. Unlike static quantization methods, BitFusion uses a lightweight controller network to predict the optimal precision for each layer or even each neuron, enabling the model to allocate higher precision to more critical computations while maintaining ultra-low precision for less sensitive parts. This approach not only improves model performance but also reduces energy consumption and latency, making it highly suitable for edge devices.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) and 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method). The hypothesis is that dynamic precision adaptation can better balance the trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency, addressing a key limitation of static quantization methods. The controller network is a creative leap that leverages the idea of adaptive systems, which have been successful in other domains like reinforcement learning.",
    "Rationale": "Current quantization methods use a fixed precision for all weights and activations, which can lead to suboptimal performance, especially in sub-4-bit regimes. By dynamically adapting precision, BitFusion can achieve higher accuracy while maintaining the benefits of low-bit quantization. This approach is particularly relevant for edge devices, where computational resources are limited, and energy efficiency is critical.",
