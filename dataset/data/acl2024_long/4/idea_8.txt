    "Title": "Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Optimal Data Selection",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for data-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. The framework uses an RL agent to select the most informative training samples from a large pool of SFT data, based on the model's current performance and learning progress. The agent is trained to maximize a reward function that balances task performance, data diversity, and sample efficiency. The framework also includes a 'data augmentation module' that generates synthetic training samples to further enhance data efficiency. This approach aims to reduce the amount of labeled data required for fine-tuning while maintaining or improving model performance.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, which emphasizes proposing new hypotheses to address scientific problems. The RL-based data selection mechanism represents a novel hypothesis for improving data efficiency in SFT. The data augmentation module is grounded in **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which focuses on designing improved methods for specific challenges.",
    "Rationale": "Fine-tuning LLMs often requires large amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This idea addresses this limitation by using an RL agent to select the most informative training samples, reducing the amount of labeled data required. The data augmentation module further enhances data efficiency by generating synthetic training samples. This approach is particularly valuable for tasks with limited labeled data, as it enables efficient fine-tuning without compromising performance.",
