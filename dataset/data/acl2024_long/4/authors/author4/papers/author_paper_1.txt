    "title": "Aligning Large Language Models via Self-Steering Optimization",
    "abstract": "Automated alignment develops alignment systems with minimal human intervention. The key to automated alignment lies in providing learnable and accurate preference signals for preference learning without human annotation. In this paper, we introduce Self-Steering Optimization ($SSO$), an algorithm that autonomously generates high-quality preference signals based on predefined principles during iterative training, eliminating the need for manual annotation. $SSO$ maintains the accuracy of signals by ensuring a consistent gap between chosen and rejected responses while keeping them both on-policy to suit the current policy model's learning capacity. $SSO$ can benefit the online and offline training of the policy model, as well as enhance the training of reward models. We validate the effectiveness of $SSO$ with two foundation models, Qwen2 and Llama3.1, indicating that it provides accurate, on-policy preference signals throughout iterative training. Without any manual annotation or external models, $SSO$ leads to significant performance improvements across six subjective or objective benchmarks. Besides, the preference data generated by $SSO$ significantly enhanced the performance of the reward model on Rewardbench. Our work presents a scalable approach to preference optimization, paving the way for more efficient and effective automated alignment."
