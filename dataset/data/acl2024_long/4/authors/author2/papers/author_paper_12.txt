    "abstract": "This paper explores the task: Chinese spelling 001 correction (CSC), from a fine-grained perspec-002 tive by recognizing that existing evaluations 003 lack nuanced typology for the spelling errors. 004 This deficiency can create a misleading impres-005 sion of models\u2019 performance, incurring an \u201cin-006 visible\u201d bottleneck hindering the advancement 007 of CSC research. In this paper, we first catego-008 rize spelling errors into six types and conduct 009 a fine-grained evaluation across a wide variety 010 of models, including BERT-based models and 011 LLMs. Thus, we are able to pinpoint the un-012 derlying weaknesses of existing state-of-the-art 013 models - utilizing contextual clues and handling 014 co-existence of multiple typos, associated to 015 contextual errors and multi-typo errors . How-016 ever, these errors suffer from low occurrence 017 in conventional training corpus. Therefore, we 018 introduce new error generation methods to syn-019 thesize their occurrence. Eventually, these aug-020 mented data can be leveraged to enhance the 021 training process of CSC models. We hope this 022 work could provide fresh insight for future CSC 023 research. 024"
