    "Title": "Cross-Domain Transfer Learning for LLMs: Leveraging Unlabeled Data from Non-NLP Domains",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of unlabeled data from non-NLP domains (e.g., scientific papers, code repositories, and financial reports) to enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs. The approach involves pre-training the model on a diverse set of unlabeled cross-domain data before applying SFT on task-specific labeled data. A novel 'domain relevance scoring' mechanism is introduced to prioritize high-relevance data during pre-training, ensuring that the model learns transferable knowledge. The framework also includes a 'domain adaptation module' that fine-tunes the model's attention mechanisms to focus on domain-specific patterns during SFT. This approach aims to improve the model's generalization and robustness across diverse tasks and domains.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Kitcher’s unified theory of science**, which advocates for interdisciplinary approaches to scientific discovery. By leveraging data from non-NLP domains, the idea bridges the gap between NLP and other fields, enabling the model to acquire transferable knowledge. The domain relevance scoring mechanism and adaptation module are inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which focuses on designing improved methods for specific challenges.",
    "Rationale": "LLMs often struggle with generalization when fine-tuned on limited task-specific data. By incorporating unlabeled data from non-NLP domains, this idea expands the model's knowledge base and enhances its ability to transfer learning across domains. The domain relevance scoring mechanism ensures that the model focuses on high-relevance data, while the adaptation module fine-tunes the model's attention mechanisms for domain-specific patterns. This approach is particularly valuable for tasks that require interdisciplinary knowledge, such as scientific reasoning or financial analysis.",
