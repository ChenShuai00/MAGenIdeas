    "abstract": "The paper overviews the 11th evaluation campaign organized by the IWSLT workshop. The 2014 evaluation offered multiple tracks on lecture transcription and translation based on the TED Talks corpus. In particular, this year IWSLT included three automatic speech recognition tracks, on English, German and Italian, \ufb01ve speech translation tracks, from English to French, English to German, German to English, English to Italian, and Italian to English, and \ufb01ve text translation track, also from English to French, English to German, German to English, English to Italian, and Italian to English. In addition to the of\ufb01cial tracks, speech and text translation optional tracks were offered, globally involving 12 other languages: Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese (B), Hebrew, Chinese, Polish, Persian, Slovenian, Turkish, Dutch, Romanian, Russian. Overall, 21 teams participated in the evaluation, for a total of 76 primary runs submitted. Participants were also asked to submit runs on the 2013 test set (progress test set), in order to measure the progress of systems with respect to the previous year. All runs were evaluated with objective metrics, and submissions for two of the of\ufb01cial text translation tracks were also evaluated with human post-editing."
