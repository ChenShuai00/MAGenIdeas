    "Title": "AutoAct++: Multi-Agent Self-Planning with Dynamic Role Allocation and Memory-Augmented Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the AutoAct framework by introducing dynamic role allocation among sub-agents and memory-augmented learning to improve task performance and generalization. The framework will allow sub-agents to dynamically adapt their roles based on task complexity and context, leveraging a shared memory system to store and retrieve past experiences. This approach reduces the need for large-scale annotated data by enabling agents to learn from their own interactions and historical data. The memory-augmented system will also facilitate better planning and decision-making by providing agents with access to relevant past trajectories and outcomes.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) and 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' (Quine’s holism). The dynamic role allocation mechanism addresses the limitation of static sub-agent groups in AutoAct, while the memory-augmented learning system enhances the agents' ability to generalize across tasks. The integration of these components aligns with the goal of reducing data dependency and improving scalability, which are critical for real-world applications.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the observation that current multi-agent systems often struggle with task-specific adaptability and generalization. By introducing dynamic role allocation and memory-augmented learning, AutoAct++ can address these challenges, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards due to its potential to significantly advance the field of autonomous agent learning."
