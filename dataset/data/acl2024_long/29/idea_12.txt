    "Title": "AutoAct-Meta: Meta-Learning for Multi-Agent Collaboration in Dynamic Environments",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a meta-learning framework for the AutoAct system, enabling agents to quickly adapt to new tasks and environments through few-shot learning. The framework will train agents on a diverse set of tasks, allowing them to generalize their learning to unseen tasks with minimal additional data. By incorporating meta-learning, AutoAct-Meta can reduce the need for large-scale annotated data and improve the agents' ability to collaborate in dynamic environments. The framework will also include a task decomposition module that automatically breaks down complex tasks into sub-tasks, which are then assigned to specialized sub-agents.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions) and 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). The meta-learning approach represents a paradigm shift in how agents are trained, while the task decomposition module improves upon the existing AutoAct framework. This combination of innovation and refinement makes the idea highly impactful.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current agent learning frameworks often require extensive retraining for new tasks, which is inefficient and resource-intensive. By introducing meta-learning, AutoAct-Meta can significantly reduce the time and data required for adaptation, making it a transformative contribution to the field of autonomous agents."
