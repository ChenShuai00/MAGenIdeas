    "Title": "Meta-Agent Learning: A Unified Framework for Multi-Task Agent Training",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a meta-agent learning framework that trains a single agent to perform multiple tasks by leveraging shared knowledge across tasks. The framework will use meta-learning to adapt the agent's planning and execution strategies based on task context, enabling it to generalize across diverse QA tasks. The system will be evaluated on a suite of QA benchmarks, demonstrating its ability to outperform task-specific agents in both performance and efficiency.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' theory (Kuhnâ€™s theory of scientific revolutions). The paradigm shift is from task-specific agents to a unified meta-agent capable of handling multiple tasks. The 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' theory also applies, as the framework integrates meta-learning into the agent training process.",
    "Rationale": "Current agent learning frameworks often require task-specific training, which limits their scalability and efficiency. This idea addresses this limitation by introducing a meta-agent learning framework that can generalize across tasks. Its potential to revolutionize agent training makes it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
