    "Title": "Tool-Augmented Multi-Agent Collaboration for Complex QA Tasks",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a tool-augmented multi-agent framework where agents collaboratively use external tools (e.g., APIs, databases) to solve complex QA tasks. The framework will include a tool recommendation system that suggests relevant tools based on task context and agent capabilities. The system will be evaluated on benchmarks like WebArena and HotpotQA, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing methods in tool-use accuracy and task completion rates.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Define New Scientific Problems' theory (Kuhn’s paradigm theory, Laudan’s problem-solving model). The problem addressed is the inefficiency of current tool-use methods in multi-agent systems. By introducing a tool recommendation system, this idea proposes a novel solution to improve tool-use accuracy. The 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' theory also applies, as the framework integrates tool-use into the multi-agent collaboration process.",
    "Rationale": "Tool-use is a critical capability for language agents, but current methods often struggle with accuracy and efficiency. This idea addresses this gap by introducing a tool recommendation system that enhances multi-agent collaboration. Its potential to improve performance on complex QA tasks makes it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
