    "Title": "AutoAct-Explain: Explainable Multi-Agent Planning via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea enhances the AutoAct framework by integrating explainable AI techniques, specifically chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, to improve the interpretability and trustworthiness of multi-agent planning. The framework will generate detailed explanations for each decision made by the agents, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind their actions. The CoT reasoning will be integrated into the planning process, enabling agents to provide step-by-step justifications for their plans. This approach will also facilitate better debugging and refinement of the agents' strategies.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on the theories of 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving) and 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' (Kitcher’s unified theory of science). The integration of CoT reasoning addresses the lack of interpretability in current agent systems, while the focus on explainability aligns with the growing demand for trustworthy AI systems. This combination of innovation and practical relevance makes the idea highly impactful.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current agent systems often operate as black boxes, making it difficult for users to trust or understand their decisions. By introducing explainable AI techniques, AutoAct-Explain can improve the transparency and reliability of multi-agent systems, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
