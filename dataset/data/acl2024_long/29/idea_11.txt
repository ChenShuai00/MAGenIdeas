    "Title": "ToolGen: Automatic Tool Synthesis for Language Agents via Self-Supervised Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a self-supervised learning framework for automatically synthesizing tools that language agents can use to solve complex tasks. The framework will generate tools by analyzing task requirements and synthesizing API calls or functional modules without human intervention. By leveraging self-supervised learning, the system can reduce reliance on large-scale annotated data and closed-source models, making it more scalable and accessible. The synthesized tools will be integrated into the AutoAct framework, enabling agents to dynamically select and use the most appropriate tools for each task.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in the theories of 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method) and 'Define New Scientific Problems' (Kuhn’s paradigm theory). The self-supervised learning approach allows for creative problem-solving and hypothesis generation, while the automatic tool synthesis addresses a gap in current methods that rely heavily on pre-defined tools. This innovation aligns with the target paper's goal of reducing data dependency and improving agent autonomy.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current language agents often rely on pre-defined tools, which limits their adaptability and scalability. By enabling agents to automatically synthesize tools, ToolGen can significantly enhance their problem-solving capabilities, making it a groundbreaking contribution to the field of autonomous agents."
