    "Title": "Self-Supervised Planning Trajectory Generation for Language Agents",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a self-supervised learning framework for generating high-quality planning trajectories without relying on annotated data or closed-source models. The framework will use contrastive learning to align agent-generated trajectories with task outcomes, enabling the agent to iteratively improve its planning capabilities. The system will be evaluated on QA tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing methods in trajectory quality and task success rates.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Propose New Hypotheses' theory (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method, Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving). The hypothesis is that self-supervised learning can effectively replace annotated data for trajectory generation, reducing reliance on costly resources. The 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' theory also applies, as this approach refines the trajectory generation process in AutoAct.",
    "Rationale": "Self-supervised learning is a promising direction for reducing the dependency on annotated data, which is a significant bottleneck in current agent learning frameworks. By leveraging contrastive learning, this idea can generate high-quality trajectories that improve task performance. Its potential to reduce costs and improve scalability makes it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
