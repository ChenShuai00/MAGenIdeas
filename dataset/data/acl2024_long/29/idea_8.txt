    "Title": "PlanGen: Automatic Plan Generation with Multi-Modal Reasoning",
    "Idea": "PlanGen is a framework for automatic plan generation that leverages multi-modal reasoning to create more accurate and context-aware plans. The framework integrates textual, visual, and structured data to generate plans that are tailored to the specific requirements of the task. PlanGen consists of three key components: (1) a **Multi-Modal Reasoner** that combines information from different modalities to generate a comprehensive understanding of the task, (2) a **Plan Generator** that uses this understanding to create a detailed plan, and (3) a **Plan Evaluator** that assesses the feasibility and effectiveness of the generated plan. PlanGen is designed to address the limitations of current plan generation methods, such as the lack of multi-modal context and the inability to evaluate plans effectively, by providing a more comprehensive and adaptive approach to plan generation.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (exploring theoretical boundaries) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (designing and improving existing methods). The rationale is that current plan generation methods often lack multi-modal context and fail to evaluate plans effectively, leading to suboptimal performance. By integrating multi-modal reasoning and plan evaluation, PlanGen addresses these limitations and provides a more robust and adaptive approach to plan generation. This approach aligns with the advancements in multi-modal reasoning seen in papers like 'Learn to Explain' and 'Language Models Meet World Models.'",
    "Rationale": "The significance of PlanGen lies in its ability to generate more accurate and context-aware plans by leveraging multi-modal reasoning. This approach improves the feasibility and effectiveness of generated plans, making language agents more capable of handling complex tasks. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards at top conferences because it addresses a critical challenge in the field of language agents and provides a novel, practical solution with broad applicability."
