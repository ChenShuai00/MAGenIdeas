    "Title": "AutoAct++: Multi-Agent Self-Planning with Dynamic Role Allocation",
    "Idea": "AutoAct++ extends the AutoAct framework by introducing dynamic role allocation among sub-agents based on real-time task complexity and agent capabilities. The system will use a meta-learning approach to adaptively assign roles (e.g., planner, executor, verifier) to sub-agents during task execution, optimizing performance and reducing redundancy. This approach will be validated on complex QA tasks requiring multi-hop reasoning and tool-use, demonstrating superior performance over static role allocation methods.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' theory (Quine’s holism, Kitcher’s unified theory of science). The current AutoAct framework uses a division-of-labor strategy but assumes static roles for sub-agents. By introducing dynamic role allocation, we can better model the fluidity of real-world tasks, where agents must adapt their roles based on evolving task requirements. This approach also aligns with the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' theory, as it refines the AutoAct framework to handle more complex scenarios.",
    "Rationale": "Dynamic role allocation addresses a key limitation in current multi-agent systems, where static roles can lead to inefficiencies in task execution. By leveraging meta-learning, AutoAct++ can optimize agent roles in real-time, leading to better performance on complex tasks. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards due to its innovative approach to multi-agent collaboration and its applicability to real-world QA tasks."
