    "title": "Knowledge Discovery from Unstructured Data in Financial Services (KDF) Workshop",
    "abstract": "Knowledge discovery from unstructured data, including business documents, web content, and news articles, has been a key AI challenge for the financial services industry. Comprehending these corpora and discovering knowledge from them, which could be textual, tabular, or graphic, are the cornerstone of supporting business decisions in the financial services domain, where information retrieval and content analysis techniques are of fundamental importance. We propose a workshop on knowledge discovery from unstructured data in financial services at SIGIR 2023 to highlight the current and emerging opportunities, invite original research, and prompt success sharing between researchers."
