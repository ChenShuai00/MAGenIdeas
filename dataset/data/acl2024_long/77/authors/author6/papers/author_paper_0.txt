    "title": "The Influence of Biomedical Research on Future Business Funding: Analyzing Scientific Impact and Content in Industrial Investments",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between scientific innovation in biomedical sciences and its impact on industrial activities, focusing on how the historical impact and content of scientific papers influenced future funding and innovation grant application content for small businesses. The research incorporates bibliometric analyses along with SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) data to yield a holistic view of the science-industry interface. By evaluating the influence of scientific innovation on industry across 10,873 biomedical topics and taking into account their taxonomic relationships, we present an in-depth exploration of science-industry interactions where we quantify the temporal effects and impact latency of scientific advancements on industrial activities, spanning from 2010 to 2021. Our findings indicate that scientific progress substantially influenced industrial innovation funding and the direction of industrial innovation activities. Approximately 76% and 73% of topics showed a correlation and Granger-causality between scientific interest in papers and future funding allocations to relevant small businesses. Moreover, around 74% of topics demonstrated an association between the semantic content of scientific abstracts and future grant applications. Overall, the work contributes to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the science-industry interface, opening avenues for more strategic resource allocation and policy developments aimed at fostering innovation."
