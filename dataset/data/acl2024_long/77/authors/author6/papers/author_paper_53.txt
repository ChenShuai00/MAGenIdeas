    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) 001 evolve rapidly as Large Language Models 002 (LLMs) was equipped with vision modules 003 to create more human-like models. How-004 ever, we should carefully evaluate their ap-005 plications in different domains, as harmful bi-006 ases may occur. Our work studies the poten-007 tial behavioral biases of LVLMs from a behav-008 ioral finance perspective, an interdisciplinary 009 area that jointly considers finance and psychol-010 ogy. We propose an end-to-end framework, 011 from data collection to new evaluation metrics, 012 to assess LVLM\u2019s reasoning capabilities and 013 dynamic behaviors manifested in two estab-014 lished human financial behavioral biases: re-015 cency bias and authority bias. Our evaluations 016 find that recent open-source LVLMs such as 017 LLaVA-NeXT, MobileVLM-V2, Mini-Gemini, 018 MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 and Phi-3-vision suf-019 fer significantly from these two biases, while 020 the proprietary model GPT-4o is negligibly im-021 pacted. This highlights a direction in which 022 open-source models can improve. 023"
