    "title": "DocuBot : Generating \ufb01nancial reports using natural language interactions",
    "abstract": "The \ufb01nancial services industry perpetually processes an over-whelming amount of complex data. Digital reports are often created based on tedious manual analysis as well as visualization of the underlying trends and characteristics of data. Often, the accruing costs of human computation errors in creating these reports are very high. We present DocuBot , a novel AI-powered virtual assistant for creating and modifying content in digital documents by modeling natural language interactions as \u201cskills\u201d and using them to transform underlying data. DocuBot has the ability to agglomerate saved skills for reuse, enabling humans to automatically generate recurrent reports. DocuBot also has the capability to continuously learn domain-speci\ufb01c and user-speci\ufb01c vocabulary by inter-acting with the user. We present evidence that DocuBot adds value to the \ufb01nancial industry and demonstrate its impact with experiments involving real and simulated users tasked with creating PowerPoint presentations."
