    "title": "Robust and Efficient Fine-tuning of LLMs with Bayesian Reparameterization of Low-Rank Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly resource-intensive to fine-tune due to their enormous size. While low-rank adaptation is a prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, it suffers from sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, leading to instability in model performance on fine-tuning downstream tasks. This paper highlights the importance of effective parameterization in low-rank fine-tuning to reduce estimator variance and enhance the stability of final model outputs. We propose MonteCLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning technique, employing Monte Carlo estimation to learn an unbiased posterior estimation of low-rank parameters with low expected variance, which stabilizes fine-tuned LLMs with only O(1) additional parameters. MonteCLoRA shows significant improvements in accuracy and robustness, achieving up to 3.8% higher accuracy and 8.6% greater robustness than existing efficient fine-tuning methods on natural language understanding tasks with pre-trained RoBERTa-base. Furthermore, in generative tasks with pre-trained LLaMA-1-7B, MonteCLoRA demonstrates robust zero-shot performance with 50% lower variance than the contemporary efficient fine-tuning methods. The theoretical and empirical results presented in the paper underscore how parameterization and hyperpriors balance exploration-exploitation in the low-rank parametric space, therefore leading to more optimal and robust parameter estimation during efficient fine-tuning."
