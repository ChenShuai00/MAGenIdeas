    "abstract": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India is the regulatory body for securities and commodity market in India. A growing number of SEBI documents ranging from government regulations to legal case files are now available in the digital form. Advances in natural language processing and machine learning provide opportunities for extracting semantic insights from these documents. We present here a system that performs semantic processing of SEBI documents using state-of-the-art language models to produce enriched regulations containing timelines of amendments and cross references to legal case files."
