    "abstract": "This paper describes the approach we used for SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Topic-based (target-dependent) sentiment analysis has become attractive and been used in some applications recently, but it is still a challenging research task. In our approach, we take the left and right context of a target into consideration when generating polarity classification features. We use two types of word embeddings in our classifiers: the general word embeddings learned from 200 million tweets, and sentiment-specific word embeddings learned from 10 million tweets using distance supervision. We also incorporate a text feature model in our algorithm. This model produces features based on text negation, tf.idf weighting scheme, and a Rocchio text classification method. We participated in four subtasks (B, C, D & E for English), all of which are about topic-based message polarity classification. Our team is ranked #6 in subtask B, #3 by MAEu and #9 by MAEm in subtask C, #3 using RAE and #6 using KLD in subtask D, and #3 in subtask E."
