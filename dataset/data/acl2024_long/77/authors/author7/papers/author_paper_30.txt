    "title": "Tweet Sentiment Analysis by Incorporating Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding and Weighted Text Features",
    "abstract": "Previous studies have used many manually identified features and word embeddings for tweet sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which incorporates sentiment-specific word embeddings (SSWE) and a weighted text feature model (WTFM). WTFM produces features based on text negation, tf.idf weighting scheme, and a Rocchio text classification method. Compared to other tweet sentiment feature generation approaches, WTFM is easy to build, simple, yet effective. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the two state-of-the-art tweet sentiment classification methods, SSWE and National Research Council Canada's (NRC) model."
