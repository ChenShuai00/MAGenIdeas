    "title": "Are ChatGPT and GPT-4 General-Purpose Solvers for Financial Text Analytics? An Examination on Several Typical Tasks",
    "abstract": "The most recent large language models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have garnered signi\ufb01cant attention, as they are capable of generating high-quality responses to human input. Despite the extensive testing of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on generic text corpora, showcasing their impressive capabilities, a study focusing on \ufb01nancial corpora has not been conducted. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by examining the potential of ChatGPT and GPT-4 as a solver for typical \ufb01nancial text analytic problems in the zero-shot or few-shot setting. Speci\ufb01cally, we assess their capabilities on four representative tasks over \ufb01ve distinct \ufb01nancial textual datasets. The prelim-inary study shows that ChatGPT and GPT-4 struggle on tasks such as \ufb01nancial named entity recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis, where domain-speci\ufb01c knowledge is required, while they excel in numerical reasoning tasks. We report both the strengths and limitations of the current versions of ChatGPT and GPT-4 , comparing them to the state-of-the-art \ufb01ne-tuned models as well as pretrained domain-speci\ufb01c generative models. Our experiments provide qualitative studies, through which we hope to help understand the capability of the existing models and facilitate further improvements."
