    "title": "Author Obfuscation: Attacking the State of the Art in Authorship Verification",
    "abstract": "We report on the first large-scale evaluation of author obfuscation approaches built to attack authorship verification approaches: the impact of 3 obfuscators on the performance of a total of 44 authorship verification approaches has been measured and analyzed. The best-performing obfuscator successfully impacts the decision-making process of the authorship verifiers on average in about 47% of the cases, causing them to misjudge a given pair of documents as having been written by \u201cdifferent authors\u201d when in fact they would have decided otherwise if one of them had not been automatically obfuscated. The evaluated obfuscators have been submitted to a shared task on author obfuscation that we organized at the PAN 2016 lab on digital text forensics. We contribute further by surveying the literature on author obfuscation, by collecting and organizing evaluation methodology for this domain, and by introducing performance measures tailored to measuring the impact of author obfuscation on authorship verification."
