    "title": "Explainable Authorship Verification in Social Media via Attention-based Similarity Learning",
    "abstract": "Authorship verification is the task of analyzing the linguistic patterns of two or more texts to determine whether they were written by the same author or not. The analysis is traditionally performed by experts who consider linguistic features, which include spelling mistakes, grammatical inconsistencies, and stylistics for example. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, can be trained to accomplish the same, but have traditionally relied on so-called stylometric features. The disadvantage of such features is that their reliability is greatly diminished for short and topically varied social media texts. In this interdisciplinary work, we propose a substantial extension of a recently published hierarchical Siamese neural network approach, with which it is feasible to learn neural features and to visualize the decision-making process. For this purpose, a new large-scale corpus of short Amazon reviews for text comparison research is compiled and we show that the Siamese network topologies outperform state-of-the-art approaches that were built up on stylometric features. Our linguistic analysis of the internal attention weights of the network shows that the proposed method is indeed able to latch on to some traditional linguistic categories."
