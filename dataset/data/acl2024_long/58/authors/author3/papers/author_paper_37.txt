    "abstract": "Modern constructivist approaches to education dictate active experimentation with the study material and have been linked with improved learning outcomes in STEM fields. During classroom time we believe it is important for students to experiment with the lecture material since active recall helps them to start the memory encoding process as well as to catch misconceptions early and to prevent them from taking root. In this paper, we report on our experiences using ASQ, a Web-based interactive presentation tool in a functional and logic programming course taught at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies at the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. ASQ allowed us to collect immediate feedback from students and retain their attention by asking complex types of questions and aggregating student answers in real time. From our experience we identified several requirements and guidelines for successfully adopting ASQ. One of the most critical concerns was how to estimate the time when to stop collecting the students' answers and proceed to their evaluation and discussion with the class. We also report the students' feedback on the ASQ system that we collected in the form of the standard SUS questionnaire."
