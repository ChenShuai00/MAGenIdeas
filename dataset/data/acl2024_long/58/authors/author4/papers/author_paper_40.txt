    "title": "Promoting Sustainability and Transferability of Community Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Community Question Answering (CQA) provides people with a possibility to ask various questions and, at the same time, provide answers on questions of other users (e.g. Yahoo! Answers). Our thesis concerns with two open emerging problems closely related to the CQA concept: (1) a long-term sustainability of CQA ecosystems, and (2) their transferability to educational and organizational environments. At first, we conducted a case study on recent negative development of Stack Overflow\u2019s community which is reflected in increasing amount of low-quality content created by undesired groups of users. Consequently, we suggested to preserve a long-term sustainability of CQA communities by means of robust reputation mechanisms and answerer-oriented adaptive support methods that in addition involve the whole community. We put these suggestions into practice by means of two novel methods: (1) for reputation calculation focused on quality of users\u2019 contributions, and (2) for recommendation of new questions to potential answerers with utilization of non-QA data. Our main contribution to the second open problem lies in introduction of a novel organization-wide educational CQA system Askalot, which takes educational as well as organizational specifics into consideration."
