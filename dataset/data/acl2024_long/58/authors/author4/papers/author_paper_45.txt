    "title": "Discovering Educational Potential Embedded in Community Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Community Question Answering (CQA) systems, such as Yahoo! Answers or Quora, are mostly perceived and studied from their primary knowledge sharing perspective. In spite of that, CQA systems have also a potential to become an effective means for people to acquire new knowledge. In the present, we can witness initial efforts on taking advance of this secondary perspective as CQA concepts have been recently applied in several educational applications. However, these educational systems take quite different approaches to the transition of CQA concepts from the open web to organizational and educational environments. One of possible reasons is that it is not clear which aspects of the question answering process have the best potential for knowledge acquisition. Therefore, we performed a study with a dataset obtained from CQA system Stack Overflow, in which we identified three scenarios that positively leads to improvement of XVHUV\u00b6 H[SHUWLVH The results of the study provide us with a better understanding how CQA systems can be applied as nontraditional learning environments."
