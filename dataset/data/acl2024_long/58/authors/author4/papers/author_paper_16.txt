    "title": "Comparison between parameter-efficient techniques and full fine-tuning: A case study on multilingual news article classification",
    "abstract": "Adapters and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques designed to make the training of language models more efficient. Previous results demonstrated that these methods can even improve performance on some classification tasks. This paper complements existing research by investigating how these techniques influence classification performance and computation costs compared to full fine-tuning. We focus specifically on multilingual text classification tasks (genre, framing, and persuasion techniques detection; with different input lengths, number of predicted classes and classification difficulty), some of which have limited training data. In addition, we conduct in-depth analyses of their efficacy across different training scenarios (training on the original multilingual data; on the translations into English; and on a subset of English-only data) and different languages. Our findings provide valuable insights into the applicability of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, particularly for multilabel classification and non-parallel multilingual tasks which are aimed at analysing input texts of varying length."
