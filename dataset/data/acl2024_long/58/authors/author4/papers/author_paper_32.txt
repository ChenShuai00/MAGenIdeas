    "title": "Monant : Universal and Extensible Platform for Monitoring , Detection and Mitigation of Antisocial Behaviour",
    "abstract": "Growing negative consequences of online antisocial behaviour have recently elicited many research efforts, aimed at mitigating or even eliminating this undesired behaviour. However, addressing the open problems is challenging (among other) due to lack of suitable datasets. Also, platforms, where the research results may be applied, are missing too. Therefore, we propose a universal and extensible platform named Monant. It is specifically designed to support characterization and detection of multiple types of antisocial behaviour. Monant does so by means of collecting multimodal, multilingual context-rich data from multiple types of web sources. In addition, the platform supports the deployment of various novel mitigation tools, where data-driven approaches can be applied. To demonstrate the unique characteristics of our platform, we conducted an experimental task in which we monitored healthcare misinformation and identified the most frequent false medical claims related to cancer treatment. Finally, we describe several use cases, which are feasible in our platform and which correspond to trending research directions."
