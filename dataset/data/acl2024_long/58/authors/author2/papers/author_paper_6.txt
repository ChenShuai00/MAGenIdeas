    "title": "Assessing the Impact of a Supervised Classification Filter on Flow-based Hybrid Network Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Constant evolution and the emergence of new cyberattacks require the development of advanced techniques for defense. This paper aims to measure the impact of a supervised filter (classifier) in network anomaly detection. We perform our experiments by employing a hybrid anomaly detection approach in network flow data. For this purpose, we extended a state-of-the-art autoencoder-based anomaly detection method by prepending a binary classifier acting as a prefilter for the anomaly detector. The method was evaluated on the publicly available real-world dataset UGR'16. Our empirical results indicate that the hybrid approach does offer a higher detection rate of known attacks than a standalone anomaly detector while still retaining the ability to detect zero-day attacks. Employing a supervised binary prefilter has increased the AUC metric by over 11%, detecting 30% more attacks while keeping the number of false positives approximately the same."
