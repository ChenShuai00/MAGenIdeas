    "title": "A Zero-Resource Approach to Cross-Lingual Query-Focused Abstractive Summarization",
    "abstract": "We present a novel approach for cross-001 lingual query-focused abstractive summariza-002 tion (QFAS) that leverages the translate-then-003 summarize paradigm. We approach cross-004 lingual QFAS as a zero-resource problem and 005 introduce a framework to create a synthetic 006 QFAS corpus from a standard summarization 007 corpus using a novel query-generation strat-008 egy. Our model summarizes documents in for-009 eign languages for which translation quality is 010 poor. It learns not only to identify and con-011 dense salient information relevant to a query, 012 but also to appropriately rephrase grammati-013 cal errors and disfluencies that may occur in 014 the noisy translations. Our technique enhances 015 a pre-trained encoder-decoder transformer by 016 introducing query focus to the encoder. We 017 show that our method for creating synthetic 018 QFAS data leads to more robust models that 019 not only achieve state-of-the-art performance 020 on our corpus, but also perform better on out-021 of-distribution data as compared to prior work. 022"
