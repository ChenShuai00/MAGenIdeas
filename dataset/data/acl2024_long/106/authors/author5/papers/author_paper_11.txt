    "title": "GUSUM: Graph-Based Unsupervised Summarization using Sentence-BERT and Sentence Features",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised extractive document summariza-001 tion aims to extract salient sentences from a 002 document without requiring a labelled corpus. 003 In existing graph-based methods, vertex and 004 edge weights are mostly created by calculat-005 ing sentence similarities. In this paper, we 006 develop a Graph-Based Unsupervised Summa-007 rization method for extractive text summariza-008 tion. We revive traditional graph ranking algo-009 rithms with recent sentence embedding models 010 and sentence features and modify how sentence 011 centrality is computed. We first use Sentence-012 BERT, a state-of-the-art method for obtaining 013 sentence embeddings to better capture the sen-014 tence meaning. In this way, we define edges 015 of a graph where semantic similarities are rep-016 resented. Then, we create an undirected graph 017 in which the calculated sentence feature scores 018 of each sentence are represented in the vertices. 019 In the last stage, we determine the most impor-020 tant sentences in the document with the ranking 021 method we suggested on the graph created. Ex-022 periments on CNN/Daily Mail and New York 023 Times datasets show our approach achieves 024 high performance on unsupervised graph-based 025 summarization when evaluated both automati-026 cally and by humans. 027"
