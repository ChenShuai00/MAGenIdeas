    "title": "Consecutive Question Generation with Multitask Joint Reranking and Dynamic Rationale Search",
    "abstract": "Automatic question generation (QG) aims to 001 generate a set of questions for a given pas-002 sage, and can be viewed as a dual task of 003 question answering (QA). However, most cur-004 rent methods of QG tend to generate ques-005 tion by question independently, mainly based 006 on speci\ufb01c extracted answer spans. In this 007 paper, we propose to consecutively generate 008 questions over a whole passage, with a com-009 prehensive consideration of the aspects includ-010 ing accuracy, diversity, informativeness, and 011 coverage. First we exam four key elements 012 in QG, i.e., question, answer, rationale, and 013 context history, and propose a novel multi-014 task framework with one main task generat-015 ing a question-answer pair, and four auxiliary 016 tasks generating other elements alternately, im-017 proving model performance from all aspects 018 through both joint training and reranking. Fur-019 ther, to learn the connection between questions 020 and fully exploit the important information in 021 every sentence, we propose a new consecutive 022 generation strategy, which dynamically selects 023 the rationales and searches for the best ques-024 tion series globally. Extensive experiments on 025 different datasets show that our method can 026 improve question generation signi\ufb01cantly and 027 bene\ufb01t multiple related NLP tasks. 028"
