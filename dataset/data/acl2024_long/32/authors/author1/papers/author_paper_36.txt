    "title": "Understanding WeChat User Preferences and \u201cWow\u201d Diffusion",
    "abstract": "WeChat is the largest social instant messaging platform in China, with 1.1 billion monthly active users. \u201cTop Stories\u201d is a novel friend-enhanced recommendation engine in WeChat, in which users can read articles based on preferences of both their own and their friends. Specifically, when a user reads an article by opening it, the \u201cclick\u201d behavior is private. Moreover, if the user clicks the \u201cwow\u201d button, (only) her/his direct connections will be aware of this action/preference. Based on the unique WeChat data, we aim to understand user preferences and \u201cwow\u201d diffusion in Top Stories at different levels. We have made some interesting discoveries. For instance, the \u201cwow\u201d probability of one user is negatively correlated with the number of connected components that are formed by her/his active friends, but the click probability is the opposite. We further study to what extent users\u2019 \u201cwow\u201d and click behavior can be predicted from their social connections. To address this problem, we present a hierarchical graph representation learning based model DiffuseGNN, which is capable of capturing the structure-based social observations discovered above. Our experiments show that the proposed method can significantly improve the prediction performance compared with alternative methods."
