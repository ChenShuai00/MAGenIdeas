    "title": "A Self-supervised Method for Entity Alignment",
    "abstract": "Entity alignment, aiming to identify equivalent entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs), is a fundamental problem for constructing large-scale KGs. Over the course of its development, supervision has been considered necessary for accurate alignments. Inspired by the recent progress of self-supervised learning, we explore the extent to which we can get rid of supervision for entity alignment. Existing supervised methods for this task focus on pulling each pair of positive (labeled) entities close to each other. However, our analysis suggests that the learning of entity alignment can actually benefit more from pushing sampled (unlabeled) negatives far away than pulling positive aligned pairs close. We present SelfKG2 by leveraging this discovery to design a contrastive learning strategy across two KGs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SelfKG without supervision can match or achieve comparable results with stateof-the-art supervised baselines. The performance of SelfKG demonstrates selfsupervised learning offers great potential for entity alignment in KGs."
