    "title": "Towards Safer Generative Language Models: A Survey on Safety Risks, Evaluations, and Improvements",
    "abstract": "As generative large model capabilities advance, safety concerns become more pronounced in their outputs. To ensure the sustainable growth of the AI ecosystem, it's imperative to undertake a holistic evaluation and refinement of associated safety risks. This survey presents a framework for safety research pertaining to large models, delineating the landscape of safety risks as well as safety evaluation and improvement methods. We begin by introducing safety issues of wide concern, then delve into safety evaluation methods for large models, encompassing preference-based testing, adversarial attack approaches, issues detection, and other advanced evaluation methods. Additionally, we explore the strategies for enhancing large model safety from training to deployment, highlighting cutting-edge safety approaches for each stage in building large models. Finally, we discuss the core challenges in advancing towards more responsible AI, including the interpretability of safety mechanisms, ongoing safety issues, and robustness against malicious attacks. Through this survey, we aim to provide clear technical guidance for safety researchers and encourage further study on the safety of large models."
