    "title": "Mining Physical Protein-protein Interactions from Literature",
    "abstract": "Background: Physical protein-protein interactions are fundamental to understand both the functions of proteins and the entire biological processes. Due to the development of high throughput experimental technologies such as the yeast two-hybrid screening, the interaction data are growing in an increasing speed. Manual curation which spends much time and cost could not keep up with the rapid growing amount of literature and the increasing number of newly discovered proteins. The need for text-mining tools to facilitate the extracting of such information is urgent. Results: During the benchmark evaluation of BioCreative 2006, all of our results rank at the top three places. In the task of \ufb01ltering articles irrelevant to physical protein interactions, our method contributes a precision of 79.95%, a recall of 89.33%, and an AUC of 87.46%, which is able to meet the demand of the practical interaction curation. In the task of identifying protein mentions and normalizing the mentions to molecule identi\ufb01ers, our result (precision=34.83%, recall=24.10%, F-score=28.49%) is one of the best among all submitted runs. In the task of extracting protein interaction pairs, our pro\ufb01le-based method contributes the best result (precision=36.95%, recall=32.68%, F-score=30.42%). Conclusions: We present a text-mining framework to extract physical protein-protein interactions. Three key issues, i.e., \ufb01ltering irrelevant articles, identifying protein names and normalizing them to molecule identi\ufb01ers, and extracting protein-protein interactions are studied in this paper. Our high-performance article \ufb01ltering algorithms, organism-based protein names normalization and pro\ufb01le-based interaction extraction"
