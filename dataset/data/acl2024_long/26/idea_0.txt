    "Title": "Dynamic Context Expansion with Adaptive Retrieval for Long-Context Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hybrid framework that combines the CEPE approach with an adaptive retrieval mechanism to dynamically expand the context window of LLMs. The framework would use a lightweight retrieval system to identify and fetch relevant external documents or passages in real-time, which are then integrated into the model's context window using CEPE's parallel encoding. The retrieval system would be trained to prioritize documents based on their relevance to the current context, ensuring that the model can access and utilize long-range dependencies efficiently. This approach would enable LLMs to handle even longer contexts (e.g., 1M tokens) while maintaining high throughput and low memory usage.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s paradigm theory, which emphasizes identifying anomalies in existing theories and exploring their boundaries. The anomaly here is the limited ability of LLMs to handle extremely long contexts, even with CEPE. By integrating retrieval-augmented methods, we can push the theoretical boundaries of long-context modeling. Additionally, Laudan’s methodological improvement model is used to enhance CEPE by adding an adaptive retrieval component, improving its efficiency and versatility.",
    "Rationale": "Current long-context models, including CEPE, are limited by their fixed context windows and struggle with tasks requiring access to external knowledge. By combining CEPE with an adaptive retrieval mechanism, we can address these limitations and enable LLMs to handle tasks like long-document summarization, multi-hop QA, and retrieval-augmented generation more effectively. This approach is novel because it integrates retrieval and context expansion in a single framework, offering a scalable solution for long-context modeling.",
