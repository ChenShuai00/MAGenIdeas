    "Title": "Unified Framework for Long-Context Modeling: Integrating State-Space Models and Attention Mechanisms",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a unified framework that integrates state-space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms to address the limitations of current long-context modeling approaches. The framework would use SSMs to capture long-range dependencies efficiently and attention mechanisms to focus on local context, combining the strengths of both approaches. The framework would be trained end-to-end, enabling it to adapt to different context lengths and tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Theory 6 (Construct and Modify Theoretical Models) and Theory 10 (Scientific Paradigm Shift). The referenced papers highlight the limitations of attention mechanisms for long-context modeling and the potential of SSMs. By integrating these approaches, this idea proposes a paradigm shift in how we model long-context sequences, addressing key challenges in scalability and efficiency.",
    "Rationale": "Current long-context models often struggle with scalability and efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. By integrating SSMs, this idea offers a more efficient alternative that can handle longer sequences without sacrificing performance, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.",
