    "Title": "Retrieval-Augmented Parallel Context Encoding for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks",
    "Idea": "This idea enhances CEPE by integrating a retrieval mechanism that dynamically retrieves relevant external knowledge during the encoding process. The retrieval mechanism would be trained jointly with the encoder to optimize the selection of external documents, enabling the model to leverage both local and global context for knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering and fact verification.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Theory 4 (Design and Improve Existing Methods) and Theory 5 (Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies). The referenced papers highlight the importance of retrieval-augmented models for knowledge-intensive tasks. By integrating retrieval into CEPE, this idea addresses the challenge of leveraging external knowledge while maintaining the efficiency of parallel context encoding.",
    "Rationale": "Current retrieval-augmented models often struggle with long-context inputs due to computational constraints. By combining retrieval with CEPE's efficient encoding framework, this idea enables LLMs to handle long-context knowledge-intensive tasks more effectively, bridging the gap between retrieval and generation.",
