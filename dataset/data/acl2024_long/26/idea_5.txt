    "Title": "Dynamic Context Compression for Infinite-Length Inputs in Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic context compression mechanism that allows language models to handle infinite-length inputs by adaptively compressing and summarizing past contexts into compact representations. The model would use a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify and retain only the most salient information from long sequences, enabling efficient processing of extremely long documents without sacrificing performance. The compressed context would be stored in a memory bank and dynamically updated as new tokens are processed, allowing the model to maintain a coherent understanding of the entire input sequence. This approach would extend the capabilities of CEPE by enabling it to handle inputs of arbitrary length, making it suitable for applications like book summarization, legal document analysis, and multi-turn dialogue systems.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s paradigm theory, which emphasizes identifying anomalies in existing theories and exploring their boundaries. The anomaly here is the fixed context window size in LLMs, which limits their ability to process infinite-length inputs. By proposing a dynamic compression mechanism, we address this limitation and push the theoretical boundaries of long-context modeling. Additionally, Laudan’s methodological improvement model is used to design a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that improves upon existing methods like CEPE.",
    "Rationale": "Current long-context models, including CEPE, are limited by fixed context windows, which restrict their applicability to tasks requiring infinite-length inputs. This idea solves this problem by introducing a dynamic compression mechanism, enabling LLMs to process inputs of arbitrary length efficiently. The hierarchical attention mechanism ensures that only relevant information is retained, reducing memory and computational costs. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize long-context modeling, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences.",
