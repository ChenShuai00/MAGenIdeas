    "Title": "Dynamic Context Adaptation for Multimodal Long-Context Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes extending the CEPE framework to support multimodal inputs (e.g., text, images, audio) by dynamically adapting the context window based on the input modality and task requirements. The framework would use a modality-specific encoder to process each input type and a unified cross-attention mechanism to integrate information across modalities. This approach would enable LLMs to handle long-context multimodal tasks, such as video captioning or document-image understanding, with improved efficiency and accuracy.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Theory 2 (Propose New Hypotheses) and Theory 4 (Design and Improve Existing Methods). The success of CEPE in extending context windows for text suggests that similar principles could be applied to multimodal inputs. By dynamically adapting the context window based on the input modality, the framework can optimize resource usage and improve performance on complex tasks.",
    "Rationale": "Multimodal tasks often require processing long sequences of heterogeneous data, which current models struggle with due to fixed context windows and modality-specific architectures. By extending CEPE to support multimodal inputs, this idea addresses a critical gap in the field and opens new research directions for multimodal long-context modeling.",
