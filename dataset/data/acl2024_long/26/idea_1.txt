    "Title": "Efficient Long-Context Attention with Sparse Memory Compression",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a sparse memory compression technique to reduce the computational and memory overhead of long-context attention mechanisms. The approach would involve compressing past tokens into a sparse representation that retains only the most salient information, which can then be efficiently queried during decoding. The compression would be guided by a learned importance scoring mechanism, ensuring that critical information is preserved while less relevant tokens are discarded. This method would be integrated into CEPE to further enhance its efficiency and scalability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Laudan’s methodological improvement model, which focuses on improving existing methods by integrating new technologies and tools. The target paper's CEPE framework already addresses memory efficiency, but this idea takes it a step further by introducing sparse memory compression. The approach also aligns with Kuhn’s paradigm theory by addressing the anomaly of high memory usage in long-context models.",
    "Rationale": "Long-context models often suffer from quadratic memory and computational complexity due to the need to attend to all past tokens. By compressing past tokens into a sparse representation, we can significantly reduce this overhead while maintaining model performance. This approach is particularly relevant for applications like streaming language models and real-time dialogue systems, where efficiency is critical.",
