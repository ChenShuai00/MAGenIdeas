    "Title": "Dynamic Context Management: A Paradigm Shift in Long-Context Modeling",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a paradigm shift in long-context modeling by introducing dynamic context management, where the context window is adjusted dynamically based on the input and task requirements. The framework would use a reinforcement learning agent to predict the optimal context window size and focus areas, enabling the model to allocate resources more efficiently and improve performance on long-context tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Theory 10 (Scientific Paradigm Shift) and Theory 6 (Construct and Modify Theoretical Models). The referenced papers highlight the limitations of static context windows and the potential of dynamic approaches. By introducing dynamic context management, this idea proposes a new way of thinking about long-context modeling, addressing key challenges in resource allocation and performance.",
    "Rationale": "Static context windows often lead to inefficiencies, especially for tasks with variable context lengths. By dynamically managing the context window, this idea enables more efficient resource allocation and better performance, making it suitable for a wide range of long-context tasks.",
