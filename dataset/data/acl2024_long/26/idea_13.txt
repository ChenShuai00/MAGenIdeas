    "Title": "Adaptive Chunking Strategies for Efficient Long-Context Processing",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an adaptive chunking strategy for CEPE that dynamically adjusts the size and overlap of input chunks based on the content and task requirements. The strategy would use a lightweight neural network to predict optimal chunking parameters, enabling the model to balance computational efficiency and context utilization. This approach would be particularly useful for tasks with variable context lengths, such as summarization or document classification.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Theory 4 (Design and Improve Existing Methods) and Theory 5 (Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies). The referenced papers highlight the challenges of fixed chunking strategies in long-context modeling. By introducing adaptive chunking, this idea addresses these challenges and improves the flexibility and efficiency of CEPE.",
    "Rationale": "Fixed chunking strategies often lead to suboptimal performance, especially for tasks with variable context lengths. By dynamically adjusting chunking parameters, this idea enables more efficient and effective long-context processing, making it suitable for a wider range of applications.",
