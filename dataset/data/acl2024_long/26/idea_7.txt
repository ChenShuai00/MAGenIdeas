    "Title": "Efficient Long-Context Modeling with Sparse Attention and Positional Interpolation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel approach to long-context modeling by combining sparse attention mechanisms with positional interpolation. The model would use sparse attention to reduce the computational complexity of processing long sequences, while positional interpolation would enable it to generalize to longer contexts than seen during training. The sparse attention mechanism would focus on the most relevant tokens, reducing memory and computational costs, while positional interpolation would ensure that the model can handle inputs of varying lengths without performance degradation. This approach would extend the capabilities of CEPE by making it more efficient and scalable.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s paradigm theory, which emphasizes exploring the limitations of existing methods. The limitation here is the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in transformers, which restricts their scalability. By proposing sparse attention and positional interpolation, we address this limitation and push the boundaries of long-context modeling. Additionally, Laudan’s methodological improvement model is used to design a novel combination of sparse attention and positional interpolation that improves upon existing methods.",
    "Rationale": "Current long-context models, including CEPE, are limited by the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, which makes them computationally expensive for very long sequences. This idea solves this problem by introducing sparse attention and positional interpolation, enabling efficient processing of long inputs. The combination of these techniques ensures that the model remains scalable and generalizable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. This innovation has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of long-context modeling, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
