    "Title": "Instruction-Tuned Long-Context Models for Task-Specific Adaptation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an instruction-tuning framework for long-context models that enables task-specific adaptation without requiring extensive fine-tuning. The model would use CEPE’s parallel context encoding to process long inputs and leverage instruction-tuning to adapt to specific tasks using only a few examples. The framework would include a task-specific prompt generator that automatically generates prompts based on the task description, enabling the model to perform well on a wide range of tasks with minimal additional training. This approach would make long-context models more versatile and easier to deploy in real-world applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s paradigm theory, which emphasizes integrating interdisciplinary knowledge to discover new problems. The problem here is the difficulty of adapting long-context models to specific tasks without extensive fine-tuning. By proposing an instruction-tuning framework, we address this challenge and push the boundaries of task-specific adaptation. Additionally, Laudan’s methodological improvement model is used to design a task-specific prompt generator that improves upon existing instruction-tuning methods.",
    "Rationale": "Current long-context models, including CEPE, often require extensive fine-tuning to adapt to specific tasks, which limits their versatility and practicality. This idea solves this problem by introducing an instruction-tuning framework that enables task-specific adaptation with minimal additional training. The task-specific prompt generator ensures that the model can perform well on a wide range of tasks, making it more versatile and easier to deploy in real-world applications. This innovation has the potential to significantly improve the practicality of long-context models, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
