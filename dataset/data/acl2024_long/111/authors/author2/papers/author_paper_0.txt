    "title": "Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization using Multimodal Guidance",
    "abstract": "Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization (OVTAL) enables a model to recognize any desired action category in videos without the need to explicitly curate training data for all categories. However, this flexibility poses significant challenges, as the model must recognize not only the action categories seen during training but also novel categories specified at inference. Unlike standard temporal action localization, where training and test categories are predetermined, OVTAL requires understanding contextual cues that reveal the semantics of novel categories. To address these challenges, we introduce OVFormer, a novel open-vocabulary framework extending ActionFormer with three key contributions. First, we employ task-specific prompts as input to a large language model to obtain rich class-specific descriptions for action categories. Second, we introduce a cross-attention mechanism to learn the alignment between class representations and frame-level video features, facilitating the multimodal guided features. Third, we propose a two-stage training strategy which includes training with a larger vocabulary dataset and finetuning to downstream data to generalize to novel categories. OVFormer extends existing TAL methods to open-vocabulary settings. Comprehensive evaluations on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and pretrained models will be publicly released."
