    "title": "Guidance Through Surrogate: Toward a Generic Diagnostic Attack",
    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) is an effective approach to making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks. Recently, different AT defenses are proposed that not only maintain a high clean accuracy but also show significant robustness against popular and well-studied adversarial attacks, such as projected gradient descent (PGD). High adversarial robustness can also arise if an attack fails to find adversarial gradient directions, a phenomenon known as \u201cgradient masking.\u201d In this work, we analyze the effect of label smoothing on AT as one of the potential causes of gradient masking. We then develop a guided mechanism to avoid local minima during attack optimization, leading to a novel attack dubbed guided projected gradient attack (G-PGA). Our attack approach is based on a \u201cmatch and deceive\u201d loss that finds optimal adversarial directions through guidance from a surrogate model. Our modified attack does not require random restarts a large number of attack iterations or a search for optimal step size. Furthermore, our proposed G-PGA is generic, thus it can be combined with an ensemble attack strategy as we demonstrate in the case of auto-attack, leading to efficiency and convergence speed improvements. More than an effective attack, G-PGA can be used as a diagnostic tool to reveal elusive robustness due to gradient masking in adversarial defenses."
