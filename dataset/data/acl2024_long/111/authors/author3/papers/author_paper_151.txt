    "title": "Aligning the Dissimilar: A Probabilistic Feature-Based Point Set Registration Approach",
    "abstract": "3D-point set registration is an active area of research in computer vision. In recent years, probabilistic registration approaches have demonstrated superior performance for many challenging applications. Generally, these probabilistic approaches rely on the spatial distribution of the 3D-points, and only recently color information has been integrated into such a framework, significantly improving registration accuracy. Other than local color information, high-dimensional 3D shape features have been successfully employed in many applications such as action recognition and 3D object recognition. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework to integrate highdimensional 3D shape features with color information for point set registration. The 3D shape features are distinctive and provide complementary information beneficial for robust registration. We validate our proposed framework by performing comprehensive experiments on the challenging Stanford Lounge dataset, acquired by a RGB-D sensor, and an outdoor dataset captured by a Lidar sensor. The results clearly demonstrate that our approach provides superior results both in terms of robustness and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic methods."
