    "abstract": "where PK is the model precision for known classes when evaluated on known class instances alone and PK\u222aU denotes the same when evaluated with unknown class instances included. On the other hand, the A-OSE metric measures the total number of unknown instances detected as one of the known classes. Both these two (WI and A-OSE) indicate the degree of confusion in predicting the known classes in the presence of unknown instances. Furthermore, we also show the comparison in terms of U-Recall for ease of comparison. It is worth mentioning that U-Recall directly relates to the unknown class and measures the model\u2019s ability to retrieve the unknown instances. The standard object detectors (Faster R-CNN and DDETR) in the top part of Tab. A1 are inherently not suited for the OWOD setting since they cannot detect any unknown object. Thereby, for these frameworks, only WI and A-OSE can be computed but not U-Recall. Since the energy-based unknown identifier (EBUI) in the recently introduced ORE [4] is learned using a held-out validation"
