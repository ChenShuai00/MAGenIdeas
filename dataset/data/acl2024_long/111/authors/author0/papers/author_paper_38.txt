    "abstract": "Objective: To examine the possible difference in the short-term BP variabilitybetween diabetic and non-diabetic hypertensives. Methodology: It is a prospective observational cohort study. The presentresearch was carried out in cardiology ward of Bahawalpur Victoria Hospital forthe duration of six months from 01-06-2018 to 30-11-2018. 392 patientsbetween 18 years to 60 years of age, including both genders are recruited in thestudy who are diabetic-hypertensives (exposed group) and hypertensiveswithout diabetes ((unexposed group) and blood pressure <140/90 mmHg bydrugs. Results: We measured 24-hr ambulatory BP in 196 diabetic hypertensive(diabetic HTN) and 196 non-diabetic hypertensive (non-diabetic HTN). Therewere no statistically significant differences in ambulatory day time systolic BP(130.71 mmHg vs. 128.88 mmHg), and night time ambulatory systolic BP(129.03 mmHg vs. 136.68 mmHg) between diabetic HTN and non-diabetic HTN.Diabetic HTN had a significantly greater day ambulatory systolic and diastolic BPvariability than non-diabetic HTN (4.80 mmHg vs. 4.18 mmHg, p < 0.05; 3.64mmHg vs. 2.80 mmHg, p < 0.05, respectively) and diabetic HTN had asignificantly greater night systolic and diastolic BP variability than non-diabeticHTN (4.99 mmHg vs. 3.88 mmHg, p < 0.05; 3.39 mmHg vs. 2.82 mmHg, p <0.05, respectively). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that BP variability is increased in diabetichypertensive. It is noted that fasting blood glucose level were found to be raised inpatients with increased BP variability. Key Words: Ambulatory blood pressure, Variability in blood pressure"
