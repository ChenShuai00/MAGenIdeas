Disorders of lipid metabolism are common in diabetes causing greater cardiovascular risks. Leukocytosis is a major marker of metabolic syndrome. Both neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are related to subclinical inflammation worsening the glycemic control. HbA1c is used as a marker of blood glucose regulation. \nOBJECTIVE: \n\u00a0To investigate the association of\u00a0 neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and platelet to lymphocyte ratio with blood glucose regulation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \n\u00a0 \nMETHODS: \nThis comparative analytical study was conducted in Shifa\u00a0 International Hospital on diabetic patients. Sample size was calculated as 62 by WHO sample size calculator .\u00a0 Non randomized convenient sampling was used. Patients were divided into two groups according to HbA1c level taking 7% as cut off point. Full blood count, lipid profile and liver profile were carried out. Data was analyzed by SPSS version 21. Descriptive statistics were calculated for categorical\u00a0\u00a0 variables. For quantitative normal and dispersed variables, independent student t and Mann Whitney U test were applied respectively. P Value less than 0.05 was considered significant. \n\u00a0 \nRESULTS: \nOut of total 93 patients,33 (35.4 %) were males and 60(64.5%) were females. The mean duration of disease was 8.26 \u00a0\u00b1 5.8 years. NLR and PLR were elevated in patients having poor glucose control but that difference was not significant. Significant difference between the groups was found with random blood glucose. LDL, triglycerides , cholesterol ratio, ALT and AST were raised in patients having poor glycemic control. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCONCLUSION: \n\u00a0Patients having poor blood glucose regulation have increased levels of\u00a0\u00a0 haematological and serological parameters posing greater cardiovascular health risks to patients with type 2 diabetes"
