    "title": "Association of Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio and Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio with Fatty Liver in Type II Diabetes Mellitus Patients",
    "abstract": "Objective: To find the association between neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, platelet to lymphocyte ratio and fatty liver in type 2 diabetes.Methodology: This comparative analytical study was conducted at Shifa International Hospital on diabetic patients visiting falahee OPD clinics from June 2018 to June 2019.\u00a0 Nonprobability convenient sampling was used. Patients were segregated into two groups according to fatty liver status as assessed by ultrasonography. Complete blood count, lipid profile and liver profile were done. Data was analyzed by using statistical package for the social sciences (spss) version 21. Descriptive statistics were calculated for categorical variables. Kolmogorov smirnov test was used to ascertain the normality of the quantitative variables. For normal and dispersed variables, independent student t and Mann Whitney U test were applied, respectively. P Value below 0.05 was considered significant.Results: Out of total 93 patients, 33 (35.4 %) were males and 60(64.5%) were females. Female patients had increased incidence of fatty liver as compared to males. The mean duration of disease was 7.61 \u00b1 5.8 years with 68.8% prevalence of fatty liver. BMI was elevated significantly in patients having fatty liver. There was no significant association between NLR, PLR and fatty liver. ALT, LDL and Triglycerides were increased significantly in patients having fatty liver.Conclusion: Patients having fatty liver have more deranged levels of lipid profile and hematological parameters increasing the risk of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases."
