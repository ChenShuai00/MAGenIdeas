    "abstract": "Training a machine learning model with adver-001 sarial examples (AEs) improves its robustness 002 against adversarial attacks. Hence, it is crucial 003 to develop effective generative models to pro-004 duce high-quality AEs. Developing such mod-005 els has been much slower in natural language 006 processing (NLP). The current state-of-the-art 007 in NLP generates AEs that are somehow hu-008 man detectable and/or include semantic and lin-009 guistic defects. This paper introduces a novel, 010 practical, and efficient adversarial attack model 011 called SSCAE for S emantic, S yntactic, and 012 C ontext-aware natural language A dversarial 013 E xamples generator. SSCAE generates hu-014 manly imperceptible context-aware AEs that 015 preserve semantic consistency and source lan-016 guage\u2019s syntactical and grammatical require-017 ments. The effectiveness and superiority of 018 the proposed SSCAE model are illustrated over 019 eleven comparative experiments, extensive ab-020 lation studies, and human evaluations. 021"
