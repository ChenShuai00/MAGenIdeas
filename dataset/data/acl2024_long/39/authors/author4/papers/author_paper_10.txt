    "title": "DiffusionShield: A Watermark for Copyright Protection against Generative Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Recently, Generative Diffusion Models ( GDM s) have showcased their remarkable capabilities in learning and generating images. A large community of GDM s has naturally emerged, further promoting the diversified applications of GDM s in various fields. However, this unrestricted proliferation has raised serious concerns about copyright protection. For example, artists including painters and photogra-phers are becoming increasingly concerned that GDM s could effortlessly replicate their unique creative works without authorization. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel watermarking scheme, DiffusionShield , tailored for GDM s. DiffusionShield protects images from copyright infringement by GDM s through encoding the ownership information into an imperceptible watermark and injecting it into the images. Its watermark can be easily learned by GDM s and will be reproduced in their generated images. By detecting the watermark from generated images, copyright infringement can be exposed with evidence. Benefiting from the uniformity of the watermarks and the joint optimization method, DiffusionShield ensures low distortion of the original image, high watermark detection performance, and the ability to embed lengthy messages. We conduct rigorous and comprehensive experiments to show the effectiveness of DiffusionShield in defending against infringement by GDM s and its superiority over traditional watermarking methods."
