    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has proven to be a cost-e\ufb00ective way to meet the demands for labeled training data in supervised deep learning models. However, crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent and noisy due to cognitive and expertise di\ufb00erences among crowd workers. Existing approaches either infer latent true labels from noisy crowdsourced labels or learn a discriminative model directly from the crowdsourced labeled data, assuming the latent true label distribution is class-balanced. Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, the true label distribution typically is imbalanced across classes. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of learning from crowdsourced labeled data with an imbalanced true label distribution. We propose a new framework, named \u201cLearning from Imbalanced Crowdsourced Labeled Data\u201d (ICED), which simultaneously infers true labels from imbalanced crowdsourced labeled data and achieves high accuracy on downstream tasks such as classi\ufb01cation. The ICED framework consists of two modules, i.e., a true label inference module and a synthetic data generation module, that augment each other iteratively. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the e\ufb00ectiveness of the ICED framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/wentao-repo/ICED ."
