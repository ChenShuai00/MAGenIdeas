    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an overview of the Unbiased Learning to Rank Evaluation 2 (ULTRE-2) task, a pilot task at the NTCIR-17. The ULTRE-2 task aims to evaluate the effectiveness of unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) models with a large-scale user behavior log collected from Baidu.com, a commercial Web search engine. In this paper, we describe the task specification, dataset construction, implemented baselines, and official evaluation results of the submitted runs."
