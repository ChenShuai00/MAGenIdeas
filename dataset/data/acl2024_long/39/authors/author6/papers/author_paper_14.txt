    "title": "FT-Shield: A Watermark Against Unauthorized Fine-tuning in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image generative models, especially those based on latent diffusion models (LDMs), have demonstrated outstanding ability in generating high-quality and high-resolution images from textual prompts. With this advancement, various fine-tuning methods have been developed to personalize text-to-image models for specific applications such as artistic style adaptation and human face transfer. However, such advancements have raised copyright concerns, especially when the data are used for personalization without authorization. For example, a malicious user can employ fine-tuning techniques to replicate the style of an artist without consent. In light of this concern, we propose FT-Shield, a watermarking solution tailored for the fine-tuning of text-to-image diffusion models. FT-Shield addresses copyright protection challenges by designing new watermark generation and detection strategies. In particular, it introduces an innovative algorithm for watermark generation. It ensures the seamless transfer of watermarks from training images to generated outputs, facilitating the identification of copyrighted material use. To tackle the variability in fine-tuning methods and their impact on watermark detection, FT-Shield integrates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for watermark detection. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed FT-Shield."
