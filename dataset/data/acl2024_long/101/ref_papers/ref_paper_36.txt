    "abstract": "It has recently been demonstrated that 3-MSH may be absent in the human pituitary (Scott & Lowry 1974) and plasma (Bloomfield et al. 1974). Studies suggest that this peptide is an artifactually formed fragment of two much larger pituitary peptides called P-lipotrophin (/-LPH), and y-lipotrophin (y-LPH). P-LPH (c. 91 amino acids) and y-LPH (c. 58 amino acids) both contain the entire sequence of 'human P-MSH' within their structures. Complete cross-reaction is found between 3-MSH, ,B-LPH and y-LPH in a radioimmunoassay which employs synthetic 'human f-MSH' (Ciba/Geigy) for standardization and iodination. There is no cross-reaction with adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) or a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (a-MSH). The present study was undertaken to compare the stability, in human plasma, of endogenous ,B-MSH-like immunoreactive material with that of added 'human /3-MSH', 3-LPH and y-LPH. Blood and plasma were obtained from a patient with Nelson's syndrome, in which levels of /3-MSH immunoreactivity were chronically high, and from a normal subject in whom the level of /3-MSH immunoreactive material had been raised by pyrogen administration. It was observed during a pyrogen test that the release of ACTH and the /-MSH-like immunoreactive material closely paralleled each other. The in vitro rate of degradation of synthetic human /-MSH (Ciba/Geigy), purified /3and y-LPH and the endogenous /-MSH-like immunoreactive material were measured in fresh plasma and whole blood. The initial level of the peptide, as measured by radioimmunoassay, was taken as"
