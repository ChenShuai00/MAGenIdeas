    "title": "Exploring Explainable Selection to Control Abstractive Generation",
    "abstract": "It is a big challenge to model long-range input for document summarization. In this paper, we target using a select and generate paradigm to enhance the capability of selecting explainable contents (i.e., interpret the selection given its semantics, novelty, relevance) and then guiding to control the abstract generation. Specifically, a newly designed pair-wise extractor is proposed to capture the sentence pair interactions and their centrality. Furthermore, the generator is hybrid with the selected content and is jointly integrated with a pointer distribution that is derived from a sentence deployment's attention. The abstract generation can be controlled by an explainable mask matrix that determines to what extent the content can be included in the summary. Encoders are adaptable with both Transformer-based and BERT-based configurations. Overall, both results based on ROUGE metrics and human evaluation gain outperformance over several state-of-the-art models on two benchmark CNN/DailyMail and NYT datasets."
