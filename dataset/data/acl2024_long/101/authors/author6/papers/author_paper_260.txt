    "title": "Topic Models for Meaning Similarity in Context",
    "abstract": "Recent work on distributional methods for similarity focuses on using the context in which a target word occurs to derive context-sensitive similarity computations. In this paper we present a method for computing similarity which builds vector representations for words in context by modeling senses as latent variables in a large corpus. We apply this to the Lexical Substitution Task and we show that our model significantly outperforms typical distributional methods."
