    "title": "OrderSum: Reading Order-Aware Unsupervised Opinion Summarization",
    "abstract": "Opinion summarization aims to create a con-001 cise summary re\ufb02ecting subjective informa-002 tion conveyed by multiple user reviews about 003 the same product. To avoid the high expense of 004 curating golden summaries for training, many 005 unsupervised methods have been recently de-006 veloped. Most state-of-the-art methods utilize 007 the extracted segments following their salience 008 ranking as pseudo labels to train a summary 009 generator. However, the extracted salient seg-010 ments can be verbose and their reading or-011 der has been long overlooked. In this paper, 012 we propose a reading order-aware framework, 013 OrderSum, aiming to generate concise and log-014 ical summaries. Speci\ufb01cally, we \ufb01rst formu-015 late the segment ordering problem in pseudo 016 labels as path-choosing and solve it using re-017 inforcement learning. Moreover, to generate 018 a more concise summary, we propose to en-019 courage the generative model to skip useless 020 words based on the token link information 021 derived from concise sentences, which can 022 be collected easily from massive raw reviews 023 by considering the ratio of sentiment/aspect 024 words. Extensive experiments demonstrate 025 that OrderSum bene\ufb01ts from the awareness of 026 reading order and the conciseness modeling, 027 thus being more effective than existing unsu-028 pervised methods and achieving the state-of-029 the-art performance. 030"
