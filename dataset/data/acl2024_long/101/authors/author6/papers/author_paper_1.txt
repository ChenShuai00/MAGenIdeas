    "title": "ScreenWriter: Automatic Screenplay Generation and Movie Summarisation",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of creative video content has driven demand for textual descriptions or summaries that allow users to recall key plot points or get an overview without watching. The volume of movie content and speed of turnover motivates automatic summarisation, which is nevertheless challenging, requiring identifying character intentions and very long-range temporal dependencies. The few existing methods attempting this task rely heavily on textual screenplays as input, greatly limiting their applicability. In this work, we propose the task of automatic screenplay generation, and a method, ScreenWriter, that operates only on video and produces output which includes dialogue, speaker names, scene breaks, and visual descriptions. ScreenWriter introduces a novel algorithm to segment the video into scenes based on the sequence of visual vectors, and a novel method for the challenging problem of determining character names, based on a database of actors' faces. We further demonstrate how these automatic screenplays can be used to generate plot synopses with a hierarchical summarisation method based on scene breaks. We test the quality of the final summaries on the recent MovieSum dataset, which we augment with videos, and show that they are superior to a number of comparison models which assume access to goldstandard screenplays."
