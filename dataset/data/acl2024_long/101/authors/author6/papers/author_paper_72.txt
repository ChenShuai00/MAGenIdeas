    "title": "FLAP: Table-to-Text Generation with Feature Indication and Numerical Reasoning Pretraining",
    "abstract": "Recent neural models have shown success in 001 table-to-text generation. However, the perfor-002 mance of content selection and content plan-003 ning is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we 004 propose an effective framework with F eature in-005 dication and numerica L re A soning P retraining 006 ( FLAP ) to help the neural generation model 007 on content selection and planning. FLAP is 008 an end-to-end generation model that takes the 009 whole table as input and utilize explicit con-010 tent selection indication with the feature indica-011 tion mechanism to ensure consistency between 012 training and inference. As numerical reasoning 013 plays a crucial role in both content selection 014 and planning. Rather than treating the table 015 as a sequence of token embeddings, we treat 016 values of a table as scalars and map the whole 017 table into a numerical vector for explicit con-018 tent selection with machine learning algorithms. 019 Additionally, we design a QA-based numerical 020 reasoning pretraining task to enhance numeri-021 cal reasoning ability of our pretrained model. 022 Experiments show that our framework outper-023 forms the strong baselines on metrics of both 024 content selection and planning on ROTOWIRE 025 and RW-FG. Thorough analyses demonstrate 026 the effectiveness of our proposed method. 027"
