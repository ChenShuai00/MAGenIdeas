    "title": "An Information Retrieval Approach to Sense Ranking",
    "abstract": "In word sense disambiguation, choosing the most frequent sense for an ambiguous word is a powerful heuristic. However, its usefulness is restricted by the availability of sense-annotated data. In this paper, we propose an information retrieval-based method for sense ranking that does not require annotated data. The method queries an information retrieval engine to estimate the degree of association between a word and its sense descriptions. Experiments on the Senseval test materials yield state-ofthe-art performance. We also show that the estimated sense frequencies correlate reliably with native speakers\u2019 intuitions."
