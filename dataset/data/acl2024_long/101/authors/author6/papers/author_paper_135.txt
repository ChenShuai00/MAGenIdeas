    "title": "Supplementary: Document Modeling with External Attention for Sentence Extraction",
    "abstract": "It is a challenging task to rely only on the main body of the document for extraction cues, as it requires document understanding. Documents in practice often have additional information, such as the title, image captions, videos, images and twitter handles, along with the main body of the document. These types of information are often available for newswire articles. Figure 1 shows an example of a newswire article taken from CNN (CNN.com). It shows the additional information such as the title (first block) and the images with their captions (third block) along with the main body of the document (second block). The last block shows a manually written summary of the document in terms of \u201chighlights\u201d to allow readers to quickly gather information on stories. As one can see in this example, gold highlights focus on sentences from the fourth paragraph, i.e., on key events such as the \u201cPM\u2019s resignation\u201d, \u201cbribery scandal and its investigation\u201d, \u201csuicide\u201d and \u201cleaving an important note\u201d. Interestingly, the essence of the article is explicitly or implicitly mentioned in the title and the image captions of the document."
