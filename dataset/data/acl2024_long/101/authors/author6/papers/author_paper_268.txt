    "title": "Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling",
    "abstract": "Large scale annotated corpora are prerequisite to developing high-performance semantic role labeling systems. Unfortunately, such corpora are expensive to produce, limited in size, and may not be representative. Our work aims to reduce the annotation effort involved in creating resources for semantic role labeling via semi-supervised learning. Our algorithm augments a small number of manually labeled instances with unlabeled examples whose roles are inferred automatically via annotation projection. We formulate the projection task as a generalization of the linear assignment problem. We seek to find a role assignment in the unlabeled data such that the argument similarity between the labeled and unlabeled instances is maximized. Experimental results on semantic role labeling show that the automatic annotations produced by our method improve performance over using hand-labeled instances alone."
