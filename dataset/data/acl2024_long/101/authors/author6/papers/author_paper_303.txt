    "title": "Automatic Evaluation of Information Ordering: Kendall\u2019s Tau",
    "abstract": "This article considers the automatic evaluation of information ordering, a task underlying many text-based applications such as concept-to-text generation and multidocument summarization. We propose an evaluation method based on Kendall's , a metric of rank correlation. The method is inexpensive, robust, and representation independent. We show that Kendall's correlates reliably with human ratings and reading times."
