    "title": "Abstractive Query Focused Summarization with Query-Free Resources",
    "abstract": "The availability of large-scale datasets has driven the development of neural sequence-to-sequence models to generate generic summaries, i.e., summaries which do not correspond to any pre-speci\ufb01ed queries. However, due to the lack of training data, query focused summarization (QFS) has been studied mainly with extractive meth-ods. In this work, we consider the problem of leveraging only generic summarization resources to build an abstractive QFS system. We propose M ARGE , a Masked ROUGE Regression framework composed of a novel uni\ufb01ed representation for summaries and queries, and a distantly supervised training task for answer evidence estimation. To further utilize generic data for generation, three attributes are incorporated during training and inference to con-trol the shape of the \ufb01nal summary: evidence rank, query guidance, and summary length. Despite learning from minimal supervision, our system achieves state-of-the-art results in the distantly supervised setting across domains and query types. 1"
