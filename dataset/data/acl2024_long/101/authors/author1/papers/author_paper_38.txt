    "title": "A Teacher-Guided Automated Essay Grading Tool using Gradient Descent Algorithm and Reflective Random Indexing",
    "abstract": "\u2014 The emergence of automated essay scoring (AES) tools is an effect of the problems of teachers in tediously checking essays of students. The AES tools proved to be useful for this task. However, current tools disables the ability of the teacher to select the criteria to be used in checking these essays. Thus, these tools are discouraged by teachers. This study made use of the gradient descent algorithm for multiple variables to automate the checking of the essay responses with teacher-guided scoring preferences. The extracted features are the word count, the keyword count, the spelling error value, the grammar error value and the content similarity value. Reflective random indexing is used to extract the content similarity value of a student essay response to the essay response provided by the teacher. The model shows an 89.78% accuracy based on the quadratic weighted kappa error (QWKE) metric. This shows that the proposed model is able to correctly grade student essays. The model was then implemented in a batch-processed essay quiz creation and scoring web application for full usage on any educational institution."
