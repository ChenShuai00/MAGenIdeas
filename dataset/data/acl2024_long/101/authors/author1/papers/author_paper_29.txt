    "title": "Translations as Additional Contexts for Sentence Classification",
    "abstract": "In sentence classification tasks, additional contexts, such as the neighboring sentences, may improve the accuracy of the classifier.\u00a0However, such contexts are domain-dependent\u00a0and thus cannot be used for another classification task with an inappropriate domain.\u00a0In contrast, we propose the use of translated sentences\u00a0as\u00a0domain-free context\u00a0that is always available regardless of the domain. We find that naive feature expansion of translations gains only marginal improvements and may decrease the performance of the classifier, due to possible inaccurate translations thus producing noisy sentence vectors. To this end, we present\u00a0multiple context fixing attachment (MCFA), a series of modules attached to multiple sentence vectors to fix the noise in the vectors using the other sentence vectors as context.\u00a0We show that our method performs competitively compared to previous\u00a0models, achieving best classification performance on multiple data sets.\u00a0We are the first to use translations as domain-free contexts for sentence classification."
