    "abstract": "Physics instruction methods have long been a challenge for front-line teachers and instructors. To improve physicsinstruction, we have developed an innovative physics instruction method that uses LEGO1to facilitate the teaching ofmechanics in middle-school physics classes. We expect the students to learn through construction and hand-on inquiry-based learning using LEGO1materials. After completing the curriculum design, lesson design, and other instruction-involved designs, we have conducted tests on two eighth-grade classes from junior middle schools in Beijing to verify theeffect of the LEGO1instruction. The preliminary experiments have revealed improvements in physics study attitudes (t =\u20133.099, p < 0.005), physics learning motivation (t = \u20133.794, p < 0.001), and inner study motivation (t = \u20132.243, p < 0.05) ofevery member of the pilot study class comprising 35 students. On the basis of these results, we have revised our instructiondesigns and subsequently conducted experiments on the experimental class totaling 33 students. The physics grades oflower-grade (t = \u20136.154, p < 0.000) and middle-grade (t = \u20134.971, p < 0.001) students improved significantly. Moreover,attitude, usability (t = \u20134.062, p < 0.000), cognitive effectiveness (t = \u20134.062, p < 0.000), and LEGO1study attitude (t =\u20132.384, p < 0.05) improved remarkably. This article gives an account of the proposed innovative physics instruction designand makes an analysis of its effectiveness using the acquired data. A discussion on the teaching methods for innovativephysics class instruction is also included."
