    "title": "Reward Teaching for Federated Multiarmed Bandits",
    "abstract": "Most of the existing federated multi-armed bandits (FMAB) designs are based on the presumption that clients will implement the specified design to collaborate with the server. In reality, however, it may not be possible to modify the clients\u2019 existing protocols. To address this challenge, this work focuses on clients who always maximize their individual cumulative rewards, and introduces a novel idea of \u201creward teaching\u201d, where the server guides the clients towards global optimality through implicit local reward adjustments. Under this framework, the server faces two tightly coupled tasks of bandit learning and target teaching, whose combination is non-trivial and challenging. A phased approach, called Teaching-After-Learning (TAL), is first designed to encourage and discourage clients\u2019 explorations separately. General performance analyses of TAL are established when the clients\u2019 strategies satisfy certain mild requirements. With novel technical approaches developed to analyze the warm-start behaviors of bandit algorithms, particularized guarantees of TAL with clients running UCB or $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$-greedy strategies are then obtained. These results demonstrate that TAL achieves logarithmic regrets while only incurring logarithmic adjustment costs, which is order-optimal w.r.t. a natural lower bound. As a further extension, the Teaching-While-Learning (TWL) algorithm is developed with the idea of successive arm elimination to break the non-adaptive phase separation in TAL. Rigorous analyses demonstrate that when facing clients with UCB1, TWL outperforms TAL in terms of the dependencies on sub-optimality gaps thanks to its adaptive design. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed algorithms."
