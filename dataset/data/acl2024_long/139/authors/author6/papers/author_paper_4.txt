    "title": "Rethinking Evaluation Practices in Visual Question Answering: A Case Study on Out-of-Distribution Generalization",
    "abstract": "Vision-and-language (V&L) models pre-trained on large-scale multimodal data have demonstrated strong performance on various tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). The quality of such models is commonly assessed by measuring their performance on unseen data that typically comes from the same distribution as the training data. However, we observe that these models exhibit poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on the task of VQA. To better understand the underlying causes of poor generalization, we comprehensively investigate performance of two pretrained V&L models under different settings ( i.e. classi\ufb01cation and open-ended text generation) by conducting cross-dataset evaluations. We \ufb01nd that these models tend to learn to solve the benchmark, rather than learning the high-level skills required by the VQA task. We also argue that in most cases generative models are less susceptible to shifts in data distribution, while frequently performing better on our tested benchmarks. Moreover, we \ufb01nd that multimodal pretraining improves OOD performance in most settings. Finally, we revisit assumptions underlying the use of automatic VQA evaluation metrics, and empirically show that their stringent nature repeatedly penalizes models for correct responses."
