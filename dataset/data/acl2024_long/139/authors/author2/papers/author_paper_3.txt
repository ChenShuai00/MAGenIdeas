    "title": "Using ensemble of ensemble machine learning methods to predict outcomes of cardiac resynchronization",
    "abstract": "The efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been widely studied in the medical literature; however, about 30% of candidates fail to respond to this treatment strategy. Smart computational approaches based on clinical data can help expose hidden patterns useful for identifying CRT responders."
