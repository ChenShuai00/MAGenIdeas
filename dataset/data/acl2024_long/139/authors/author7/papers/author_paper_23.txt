    "title": "TABi: Type-Aware Bi-encoders for End-to-End Entity Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Entity retrieval\u2014retrieving information about 001 entities in a query\u2014is a core step in open-002 domain tasks, such as question answering or 003 fact checking. However, state-of-the-art entity 004 retrievers struggle to retrieve rare entities in 005 queries. There are two key challenges: (1) most 006 retrievers are trained on unstructured text about 007 entities and ignore structured data about enti-008 ties that can be challenging to learn from text, 009 such as entity types, and (2) methods that lever-010 age structured types are not designed for end-011 to-end retrieval, which is necessary for open-012 domain tasks. In this work, we introduce TABi, 013 a method to jointly train bi-encoders on unstruc-014 tured text and structured types for end-to-end 015 retrieval. TABi uses a type-enforced contrastive 016 loss to encode type information in the embed-017 ding space and trains over datasets from multi-018 ple open-domain tasks to learn to retrieve enti-019 ties. We demonstrate that this simple method 020 can improve retrieval of rare entities on the Am-021 bER sets, while maintaining strong overall per-022 formance on retrieval for open-domain tasks 023 when compared to state-of-the-art retrievers. 024 We also find that TABi produces embeddings 025 that better capture types on a nearest neighbor 026 type classification and an entity similarity task. 027"
