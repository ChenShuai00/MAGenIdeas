    "title": "The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling",
    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that increased training dataset diversity improves general cross-domain knowledge and downstream generalization capability for large-scale language models. With this in mind, we present the Pile : an 825 GiB English text corpus tar-geted at training large-scale language models. The Pile is constructed from 22 diverse high-quality subsets\u2014both existing and newly constructed\u2014many of which derive from academic or professional sources. Our evaluation of the untuned performance of GPT-2 and GPT-3 on the Pile shows that these models struggle on many of its components, such as academic writing. Conversely, models trained on the Pile improve signi\ufb01cantly over both Raw CC and CC-100 on all components of the Pile, while improving performance on downstream evaluations. Through an in-depth exploratory analysis, we document potentially concerning aspects of the data for prospective users. We make publicly available the code used in its construction. 1"
