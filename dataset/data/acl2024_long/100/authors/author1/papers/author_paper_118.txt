    "title": "Exemplar-based Robust Coherent Biclustering",
    "abstract": "The biclustering, co-clustering, or subspace clustering problem involves simultaneously grouping the rows and columns of a data matrix to uncover biclusters or sub-matrices of the data matrix that optimize a desired objective function. In coherent biclustering, the objective function contains a coherence measure of the biclusters. We introduce a novel formulation of the coherent biclustering problem and use it to derive two algorithms. The first algorithm is based on loopy message passing; and the second relies on a greedy strategy yielding an algorithm that is significantly faster than the first. A distinguishing feature of these algorithms is that they identify an exemplar or a prototypical member of each bi-cluster. We note the interference from background elements in bi-clustering, and offer a means to circumvent such interference using additional regularization. Our experiments with synthetic as well as real-world datasets show that our algorithms are competitive with the current stateof-the-art algorithms for finding coherent bi-clusters."
