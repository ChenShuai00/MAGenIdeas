    "title": "Latent Dependency Forest Models",
    "abstract": "\n \n Probabilistic modeling is one of the foundations of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel type of probabilistic models named latent dependency forest models (LDFMs). A LDFM models the dependencies between random variables with a forest structure that can change dynamically based on the variable values. It is therefore capable of modeling context-specific independence. We parameterize a LDFM using a first-order non-projective dependency grammar. Learning LDFMs from data can be formulated purely as a parameter learning problem, and hence the difficult problem of model structure learning is circumvented. Our experimental results show that LDFMs are competitive with existing probabilistic models.\n \n"
