    "title": "Tyche: A Risk-Based Permission Model for Smart Homes",
    "abstract": "Emerging smart home platforms, which interface with a variety of physical devices and support third-party application development, currently use permission models inspired by smartphone operating systems-the permission to access operations are separated by the device which performs them instead of their functionality. Unfortunately, this leads to two issues: (1) apps that do not require access to all of the granted device operations have overprivileged access to them, (2) apps might pose a higher risk to users than needed because physical device operations are fundamentally risk-asymmetric-\"door.unlock\" provides access to burglars, and \"door.lock\" can potentially lead to getting locked out. Overprivileged apps with access to mixed-risk operations only increase the potential for damage. We present Tyche, a secure development methodology that leverages the risk-asymmetry in physical device operations to limit the risk that apps pose to smart home users, without increasing the user's decision overhead. Tyche introduces the notion of risk-based permissions for IoT systems. When using risk-based permissions, device operations are grouped into units of similar risk, and users grant apps access to devices at that risk-based granularity. Starting from a set of permissions derived from the popular Samsung SmartThings platform, we conduct a user study involving domain-experts and Mechanical Turk users to compute a relative ranking of risks associated with device operations. We find that user assessment of risk closely matches that of domain experts. Using this insight, we define risk-based groupings of device operations, and apply it to existing SmartThings apps. We show that existing apps can reduce access to high-risk operations by 60% while remaining operable."
