    "title": "Abstract 4139998: New-onset atrial fibrillation following coronary artery bypass graft surgery: A systematic review",
    "abstract": "\n Background:\n Post coronary artery bypass surgery atrial fibrillation (Post-CABG AF) was reported to have variable incidence ranging from 10 to 40% and also noted to have a significant risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. This systematic review evaluated the incidence and adverse outcomes of post-CABG AF.\n \n \n Methods:\n The search period was from 1 January 2010 to September 30, 2023. We conducted a literature search in PubMed of English language, peer-reviewed manuscripts. We included observational and experimental studies among patients who underwent CABG and developed new-onset atrial fibrillation. We analyzed the overall incidence of new-onset AF, 30-day mortality, and adverse outcomes, including cerebrovascular accidents.\n \n \n Results:\n Thirty-two manuscripts, including findings from two randomized controlled trials conducted among patients with post-CABG new onset atrial fibrillation were reviewed, comprising of 150,788 patients. Of these, 39,327 (26%) developed new-onset post-CABG AF. The median age of patients with new onset post-CABG is 67.5 (IQR 66-69) years, with 52.5% males. The average incidence of cerebrovascular accidents calculated from four manuscripts was 6.26% and 3.38% among patients with and without new-onset AF post-CABG, respectively, with RR 1.92 (95% CI 1.69 - 2.18). Four studies described 30 days of mortality risk, which averaged at 3.05% and 1.46% among patients with and without new-onset AF post-CABG, respectively, with RR 2.08 (95% CI 1.77,2.45).\n \n \n Conclusion:\n This systematic analysis shows a higher incidence of post-CABG new-onset AF, along with a significant increase in 30-day mortality risk and incidence of cerebrovascular accident when compared to patients who did not develop new-onset AF postoperatively. We propose further studies on determining solutions for post-CABG AF.\n"
