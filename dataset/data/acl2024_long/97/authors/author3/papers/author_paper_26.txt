    "title": "SEA: Shareable and Explainable Attribution for Query-based Black-box Attacks",
    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, particularly those from query-based black-box attacks. Despite various efforts to detect and prevent such attacks, there is a need for a more comprehensive approach to logging, analyzing, and sharing evidence of attacks. While classic security benefits from well-established forensics and intelligence sharing, Machine Learning is yet to find a way to profile its attackers and share information about them. In response, this paper introduces SEA, a novel ML security system to characterize black-box attacks on ML systems for forensic purposes and to facilitate human-explainable intelligence sharing. SEA leverages the Hidden Markov Models framework to attribute the observed query sequence to known attacks. It thus understands the attack's progression rather than just focusing on the final adversarial examples. Our evaluations reveal that SEA is effective at attack attribution, even on their second occurrence, and is robust to adaptive strategies designed to evade forensics analysis. Interestingly, SEA's explanations of the attack behavior allow us even to fingerprint specific minor implementation bugs in attack libraries. For example, we discover that the SignOPT and Square attacks implementation in ART v1.14 sends over 50% specific zero difference queries. We thoroughly evaluate SEA on a variety of settings and demonstrate that it can recognize the same attack's second occurrence with 90+% Top-1 and 95+% Top-3 accuracy."
