    "abstract": "The Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) protocol stack is one of the most important protocols proposed to standardize and allocate spectrum for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. In a previous work, we proved that WAVE faces a spectrum scarcity problem which hinders reliable exchange of safety information. To overcome this problem, we proposed a system that applies cognitive networks principles to WAVE as to increase the spectrum allocated to the control channel (CCH) by the IEEE 802.11p amendment, where all safety information is transmitted. However, the decision making process in our previous work did not utilize the extra spectrum efficiently as it was not allocated according to the contention level experienced by the vehicle. In this paper, we suggest a system that employs a fuzzy logic system (FLS) to dynamically assign additional spectrum from the ISM band to the CCH. This system, which we call FCVANET, assigns the minimum necessary additional bandwidth to relieve the contention. The FLS takes as input 2 parameters, the message delay and the un-transmitted packets and utilizes a feedback loop. Our simulations show that the proposed system allocates bandwidth more efficiently in accordance with the contention level faced by the vehicles. The system succeeds to relieve contention by reducing delay and the number of un-transmitted packets."
