    "abstract": "The Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) protocol stack is one of the most important protocols used to allocate spectrum for vehicular communication. In a previous work, we proved that WAVE does not provide sufficient spectrum for reliable exchange of safety information. More specifically, safety message delay is not acceptable and exceeds application requirements. In this paper, we propose a system that provides Data delivery guarantees using Cognitive networks principles in congested Vehicular ad hoc networks. We will refer to our system as DCV. Our goal is to ensure that all safety packets get generated and transmitted during the same interval. The system monitors the contention delay experienced by cars on the control channel where all safety packets should be transmitted. If the sensed contention delay exceeds delay threshold \u03b3, the Road Side Unit (RSU) needs to increase the spectrum allocated to the control channel using cognitive networks. The RSU employs a feedback control design where additional bandwidth is added to drive the contention delay below the delay threshold \u03b3 used as reference input for the controller. Analysis and simulations indicate the effectiveness of the system in providing data delivery guarantees in vehicular networks and thus increasing safety measures on the road."
