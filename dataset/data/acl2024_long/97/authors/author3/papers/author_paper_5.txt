    "title": "Evaluating the Impact of Warning Modalities and False Alarms in Pedestrian Crossing Alert System",
    "abstract": "With the steadily increasing pedestrian fatalities, pedestrian safety is a growing concern, especially in urban environments. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been developed to mitigate road user risks by predicting potential pedestrian crossings and issuing timely driver alerts. However, there is limited understanding of how drivers respond to different modalities of alerts, particularly in the presence of false alarms. In this study, we utilized a full-scale driving simulator to compare the effectiveness of different alert modalities, audio-visual (AV), visual-tactile (VT), and audio-visual-tactile (AVT), in alerting drivers to various pedestrian jaywalking events. Our findings reveal that, compared to no alerts, multimodal alerts significantly increased the number of vehicles stopped for pedestrians and the distance to pedestrians when stopped. However, the false alarms negatively impacted driver trust, with some drivers exhibiting excessive caution, alert fatigue and anxiety, even including one instance where a driver fully stopped when no pedestrian was present."
