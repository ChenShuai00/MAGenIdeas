    "title": "Dynamic Simulations of VANET Scenarios",
    "abstract": "- Vehicular ad hoc networks, also known as VANETs, constitute a major pillar in making the dream of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) come true. By enabling vehicles to communicate with each other, it would be possible to have safer and more efficient roads where drivers and concerned authorities are supplied with timely information. Based on a short to medium range communication systems, VANETs can enable both safety and entertainment types of applications to come to reality. Unfortunately, the application layer has not received sufficient attention. Although some of the undergoing projects have touched on the subject, their works do not seriously cover issues dealing with actual implementations of VANET scenarios. This paper describes some application layer scenarios which we developed using the network simulator ns2. We describe the limitations of ns2 as it concerns VANET simulations and our implemented solution, and then move on to considering car braking and changing lane scenarios in order to demonstrate how such applications may work."
