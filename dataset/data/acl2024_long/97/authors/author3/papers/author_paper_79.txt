    "title": "Replication enabled distributed cache invalidation method: replication enabled distributed cache management system for wireless mobile networks",
    "abstract": "This work proposes a replication scheme that is implemented on top of a previously proposed system for MANETs that cache submitted queries in special nodes, called query directories, and uses them to locate the data responses that are stored in the nodes that first request them, called caching nodes. The system, which was named distributed cache invalidation method DCIM, includes client-based mechanisms for keeping the cached data consistent with the data source. In this work, we extend DCIM to handle cache replicas inside the MANET. For this purpose, we utilize a push-based approach within the MANET to propagate the server updates to replicas inside the network. The result is a hybrid approach that utilizes the benefits of pull approaches for client server communication and those of push approaches inside the network between the replicas. The approach is analyzed analytically, and the appropriate number of replicas is obtained, where it was concluded that full replication of the indices of data items at the query directory and two-partial replication of the data items themselves makes most sense. Simulation results based on ns2 demonstrate the ability of the added replication scheme to lower delays and improve hit ration at the cost of mild increases in overhead traffic.
