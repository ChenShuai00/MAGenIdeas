    "title": "Adaptive Ensembles of Fine-Tuned Transformers for LLM-Generated Text Detection",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have reached human-like proficiency in generating diverse textual content, underscoring the necessity for effective fake text detection to avoid potential risks such as fake news in social media. Previous research has mostly tested single models on in-distribution datasets, limiting our understanding of how these models perform on different types of data for LLM-generated text detection tasks. We researched this by testing five specialized transformer-based models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets to better assess their performance and generalizability. Our results revealed that single transformer-based classifiers achieved decent performance on the in-distribution dataset but limited generalization ability on the out-of-distribution dataset. To improve it, we combined the individual classifier models using adaptive ensemble algorithms, which improved the average accuracy significantly from 91.8% to 99.2% on an in-distribution test set and from 62.9% to 72.5% on an out-of-distribution test set. The results indicate the effectiveness, good generalization ability, and great potential of adaptive ensemble algorithms in LLM-generated text detection."
