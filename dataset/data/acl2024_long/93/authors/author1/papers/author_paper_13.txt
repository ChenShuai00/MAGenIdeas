    "title": "Eliminating Spurious Correlations from Pre-trained Models via Data Mixing",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models pre-trained on large datasets have achieved remarkable convergence and robustness properties. However, these models often exploit spurious correlations between certain attributes and labels, which are prevalent in the majority of examples within speci\ufb01c categories but are not predictive of these categories in general. The learned spurious correlations may persist even after \ufb01ne-tuning on new data, which degrades models\u2019 performance on examples that do not exhibit the spurious correlation. In this work, we propose a simple and highly effective method to eliminate spurious correlations from pre-trained models. The key idea of our method is to leverage a small set of examples with spurious attributes, and balance the spurious attributes across all classes via data mixing. We theoretically con\ufb01rm the effectiveness of our method, and empirically demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on various vision and NLP tasks, including eliminating spurious correlations from pre-trained ResNet50 on Waterbirds and CelebA, adversarially pre-trained ResNet50 on ImageNet, and BERT pre-trained on CivilComments."
