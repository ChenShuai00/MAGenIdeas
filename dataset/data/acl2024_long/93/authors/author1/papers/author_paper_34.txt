    "title": "Near optimal representative subset selection from short sequences generated by a stationary source",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of representative subset selection for model training and identification, particularly for the applications in universal compression. We used the Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure the distance between the estimated model from the representative subset and the source model resulting from the entire data in the set. As directly solving the original projection problem is NP-hard and not practical for large data-sets, we proposed a different approximate algorithm, based on \u21132 optimization with \u21130 constraints. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the KL-Divergence that relates monotonically (increasingly) to the \u21132 cost function. Hence, we can bound KL-divergence penalty by minimizing the \u21132-norm. Using experimental results, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed \u21132-norm method."
