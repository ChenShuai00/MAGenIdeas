    "title": "Iterative similarity inference via message passing in factor graphs for Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm for similarity computation to improve the recommendation accuracy of the neighborhood method, which is one of the most popular Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation algorithms. We formulate a probabilistic inference problem as to compute the marginal posterior distributions of similarity variables from their joint posterior distribution given the observed ratings. However, direct computation is prohibitive in large-scale recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce an appropriate chosen factor graph to express the factorization of the joint distribution function, and utilize the BP algorithm that operates in the factor graph to exploit the factorization for efficient inference. In addition, since the high degree at the factor node incurs an exponential increase in computational complexity, we also propose a complexity-reduction technique. The overall complexity of the proposed BP algorithm on a factor graph is linear in the number of variables, which ensures scalability. Finally, through experiments on the MovieLens dataset, we show the superior prediction accuracy of the proposed BP-based similarity computation algorithm for recommendation."
