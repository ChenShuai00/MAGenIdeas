    "title": "Results on the Improved Decoding Algorithm for Low-Density Parity-Check Codes Over the Binary Erasure Channel",
    "abstract": "In this correspondence, we first investigate some analytical aspects of the recently proposed improved decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC). We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the improved decoding algorithm to successfully complete decoding when the decoder is initialized to guess a predetermined number of guesses after the standard message-passing terminates at a stopping set. Furthermore, we present improved bounds on the number of bits to be guessed for successful completion of the decoding process when a stopping set is encountered. Under suitable conditions, we derive a lower bound on the number of iterations to be performed for complete decoding of the stopping set. We then present a superior, novel improved decoding algorithm for LDPC codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC). The proposed algorithm combines the observation that a considerable fraction of unsatisfied check nodes in the neighborhood of a stopping set are of degree two, and the concept of guessing bits to perform simple and intuitive graph-theoretic manipulations on the Tanner graph. The proposed decoding algorithm has a complexity similar to previous improved decoding algorithms. Finally, we present simulation results of short-length codes over BEC that demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over previous improved decoding algorithms for a wide range of bit error rates"
