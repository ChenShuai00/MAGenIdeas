    "title": "A General Framework for the Design of Compressive Sensing using Density Evolution",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a general framework to design a sparse sensing matrix ${\\mathbf {A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, in a linear measurement system ${\\mathbf {y = Ax}}^{\\sharp } + {\\mathbf {w}}$, where ${\\mathbf {y}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, {\\mathbf {x}}^{\\sharp } \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and w denote the measurements, the signal with certain structures, and the measurement noise, respectively. By viewing the signal reconstruction from the measurements as a message passing algorithm over a graphical model, we leverage tools from coding theory in the design of low density parity check codes, namely the density evolution, and provide a framework for the design of matrix A. Particularly, compared to the previous methods, our proposed framework enjoys the following desirable properties: (i) Universality: the design supports both regular sensing and preferential sensing, and incorporates them in a single frame-work; (ii) Flexibility: the framework can easily adapt the design of A to a signal $x^{\\sharp }$ with different underlying structures. As an illustration, we consider the $\\ell_{1}$ regularizer, which correspond to Lasso, for both the regular sensing and preferential sensing scheme. Noteworthy, our framework can reproduce the classical result of Lasso, i.e., $m \\geq c_{0}k\\log (n/k)$ (the regular sensing) with regular design after proper distribution approximation, where $c_{0}\\gt 0$ is some fixed constant. We also provide numerical experiments to confirm the analytical results and demonstrate the superiority of our framework whenever a preferential treatment of a sub-block of vector $x^{\\sharp }$ is required."
