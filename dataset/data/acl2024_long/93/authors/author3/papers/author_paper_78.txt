    "title": "A Distributed Principal Component Analysis Compression for Smart Seismic Acquisition Networks",
    "abstract": "This paper develops a new framework for data compression in seismic sensor networks by using the distributed principal component analysis (DPCA). The proposed DPCA scheme compresses all seismic traces in the network at the sensor level. First of all, the statistics of the seismic traces acquired at all sensors are represented by a mixture model of a number of probability density functions. Based on this mixture model, the DPCA finds the global PCs at the fusion center. These PCs are then sent back to all sensors so that each sensor projects its own traces over these PCs. This scheme does not require transmitting the original traces, here, leading to a low computational load and a high compression ratio, compared with compression obtained using the local PC analysis (LPCA). Furthermore, we develop an efficient communication solution for the DPCA implementation on practical sensor networks. Finally, the proposed scheme is evaluated using real and synthetic seismic data showing improved performance over the LPCA and the traditional 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT-2-D) compression. Specifically, to preserve a given signal energy during the compression, the DPCA is shown to achieve a higher compression ratio than the LPCA and the DCT-2-D."
