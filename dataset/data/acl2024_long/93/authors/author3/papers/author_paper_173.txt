    "title": "A Novel Collaboration Scheme for Multi-Channel/Interface Network Coding",
    "abstract": "Multi-channel, multi-interface ad hoc wireless networks can obtain substantial capacity improvements by mitigating co-channel interference. Channel assignment and routing algorithms that relieve co-channel interference and balance traffic loads are critical for obtaining these large capacity increases. However, with a limited number of channels and interfaces, this approach cannot avoid traffic overload as the network traffic increases. This paper proposes a novel scheme of multi-channel/interface network coding that is based on the combination of a new concept of coded-overhearing and coding-aware channel assignment. The proposed algorithms overcome the radio coverage limitations present in conventional network coding schemes, and exhibit improved flexibility in terms of aggregate throughput when there are an insufficient number of interfaces and a outage of network coding opportunities. Our scheme attains significant improvement in the aggregate throughput as compared to a no network coding scheme."
