    "title": "Time-based sampling of social network activity graphs",
    "abstract": "While most research in online social networks (OSNs) in the past has focused on static friendship networks, social network activity graphs are quite important as well. However, characterizing social network activity graphs is computationally intensive; reducing the size of these graphs using sampling algorithms is critical. There are two important requirements---the sampling algorithm must be able to preserve core graph characteristics and be amenable to a streaming implementation since activity graphs are naturally evolving in a streaming fashion. Existing approaches satisfy either one or the other requirement, but not both. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling algorithm called Streaming Time Node Sampling (STNS) that exploits temporal clustering often found in real social networks. Using real communication data collected from Facebook and Twitter, we show that STNS significantly out-performs state-of-the-art sampling mechanisms such as node sampling and Forest Fire sampling, across both averages and distributions of several graph properties."
