    "title": "A Framework for Efficient Class-based Sampling",
    "abstract": "With an increasing requirement for network monitoringtools to classify traf\ufb01c and track security threats, newer a ndef\ufb01cient ways are needed for collecting traf\ufb01c statistics a ndmonitoring of network \ufb02ows. However, traditional solution sbased on random packet sampling based treat all \ufb02ows asequal and therefore, do not provide the \ufb02exibility requiredfor these applications. For example, network operators areoften interested in observing as many unique \ufb02ows as possibl e;however, random packet sampling is inherently biased towardslarge \ufb02ows thus making it unsuitable for such application.Operators may also be interested in increasing the \ufb01delity o f\ufb02ow measurements for a certain class of \ufb02ows, which cannotbe achieved in such frameworks. In this paper, we proposea novel architecture called CLAMP that provides an ef\ufb01cientframework to implement class-based sampling. At the heartof CLAMP is a novel data structure called Composite Bloom\ufb01lter (CBF) that consists of a set of Bloom \ufb01lters that worktogether to encapsulate various class de\ufb01nitions. We show t he\ufb02exibility and ef\ufb01cacy of CLAMP by implementing two-classsize-based sampling. We also consider different objectivessuch as maximizing \ufb02ow coverage and improving the accuracyof certain class of \ufb02ows. In comparison to previous approach esthat implement simple size-based sampling, our architecturerequires substantially lower memory (upto 80x) and resultsin higher \ufb02ow coverage (upto 8x more \ufb02ows) under speci\ufb01ccon\ufb01gurations.II.
