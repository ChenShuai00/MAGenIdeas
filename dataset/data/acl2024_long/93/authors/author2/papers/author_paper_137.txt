    "abstract": "\u2014Multi-rooted tree topologies are commonly used to construct high-bandwidth data center network fabrics. In these networks, switches typically rely on equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing techniques to split traf\ufb01c across multiple paths, where each \ufb02ow is routed through one of the available paths, but packets within a \ufb02ow traverse the same end-to-end path. Unfortunately, since ECMP splits traf\ufb01c based on \ufb02ow-granularity, it can cause load imbalance across multiple paths resulting in poor utilization of network resources. More \ufb01ne-grained traf\ufb01c splitting techniques are typically not preferred because they can cause packet reordering that can, according to conventional wisdom, lead to severe TCP throughput degradation. In this paper, we revisit this fact in the context of regular data center topologies such as fat-tree architectures. We argue that packet-level traf\ufb01c splitting, where packets belong to a given \ufb02ow are sprayed through all available paths, would lead to a better load-balanced network, which in turn leads to signi\ufb01cantly more balanced queues and much higher throughput compared to ECMP. We conduct extensive simulations to corroborate this claim."
