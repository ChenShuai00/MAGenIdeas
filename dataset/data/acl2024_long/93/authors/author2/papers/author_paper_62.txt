    "abstract": "Many enterprises use the cloud to host applications such as web services, big data analytics and storage. One common characteristic among these applications is that, they involve significant I/O activities, moving data from a source to a sink, often without even any intermediate processing. However, cloud environments tend to be virtualized in nature with tenants obtaining virtual machines (VMs) that often share CPU. Virtualization introduces a significant overhead for I/O activity as data needs to be moved across several protection boundaries. CPU sharing introduces further delays into the overall I/O processing data flow. In this paper, we propose a simple abstraction called vPipe to mitigate these problems. vPipe introduces a simple \u201cpipe\u201d that can connect data sources and sinks, which can be either files or TCP sockets, at the virtual machine monitor (VMM) layer. Shortcutting the I/O at the VMM layer achieves significant CPU savings and avoids scheduling latencies that degrade I/O throughput. Our evaluation of vPipe prototype on Xen shows that vPipe can improve file transfer throughput significantly while reducing overall CPU utilization."
