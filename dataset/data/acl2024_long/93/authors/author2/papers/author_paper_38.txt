    "title": "Packet switching in quantum networks: A path to the quantum Internet",
    "abstract": "Large-scale quantum networks with thousands of nodes require scalable network protocols and physical hardware to realize. In this work, we introduce packet switching as a new paradigm for quantum data transmission in both future and near-term quantum networks. We propose a classical-quantum data frame structure and explore methods of frame generation and processing. Further, we present conceptual designs for a quantum recon\ufb01gurable optical add-drop multiplexer to realize the proposed transmission scheme. Packet switching allows for a universal design for a next generation Internet where classical and quantum data share the same network protocols and infrastructure. In this new quantum networking paradigm, entanglement distribution, as with quantum key distribution, is an application built on top of the quantum network rather than as a network designed especially for those purposes. For analysis of the network model, we simulate the feasibility of quantum packet switching for some preliminary models of quantum key and entanglement distribution. Finally, we discuss how our model can be integrated with other network models toward a realization of a quantum Internet."
