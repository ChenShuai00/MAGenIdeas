    "title": "Amplifying Object Tracking Performance on Edge Devices",
    "abstract": "Object tracking is an important functionality of edge video analytic systems and services. Multi-object tracking (MOT) detects the moving objects and tracks their locations frame by frame as real scenes are being captured into a video. However, it is well known that real time object tracking at the edge poses critical technical challenges, especially with edge devices of heterogeneous computing resources. This paper examines the performance issues and edge-specific optimization opportunities for object tracking. We will show that even the well trained and optimized MOT model may still suffer from random frame dropping problems when edge devices have insufficient computation resources. We present several edge specific performance optimization strategies, collectively coined as EMO, to speed up the real time object tracking, ranging from window-based optimization to similarity based optimization. Extensive experiments on popular MOT benchmarks demonstrate that our EMO approach is competitive with respect to the representative methods for on-device object tracking techniques in terms of run-time performance and tracking accuracy. EMO is released on Github at https://github.com/git-disl/EMO."
