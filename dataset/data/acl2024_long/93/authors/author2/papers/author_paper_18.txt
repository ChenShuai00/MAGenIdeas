    "abstract": "In entanglement distribution networks, communication between two nodes necessitates the generation of end-to-end entanglement by entanglement swapping at intermediate nodes. Efficiently creating end-to-end entanglements over long distances is a key objective. In our prior study on asynchronous routing, we enhanced these entanglement rates by leveraging solely the local knowledge of the node's entanglement links. This was achieved by creating a tree structure, particularly a destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) or a spanning tree, eliminating synchronous operations and conserving unused entanglement links. In this article, we present a multi-tree approach with multiple DODAGs designed to improve end-to-end entanglement rates in large-scale networks, specifically catering to a range of network topologies, including grids and barbells, as well as realistic topologies found in research testbeds like ESnet and Internet2. Our simulations show a marked improvement in end-to-end entanglement rates for specific topologies compared to the single-tree method. This study underscores the promise of asynchronous routing schemes in quantum networks, highlighting the effectiveness of asynchronous routing across different network topologies and proposing a superior routing tactic."
