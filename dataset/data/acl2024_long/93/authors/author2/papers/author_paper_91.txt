    "title": "Leave Them Microseconds Alone: Scalable Architecture for Maintaining Packet Latency Measurements",
    "abstract": "Latency has become an important metric for network monitoring since the emergence of new latency-sensitive applications ( e.g. , algorithmic trading and high-performance computing). To satisfy the need, researchers have proposed new architectures such as LDA and RLI that can provide \ufb01ne-grained latency measurements. However, these architectures are fundamentally ossi\ufb01ed in their design as they are designed to provide only a speci\ufb01c pre-con\ufb01gured aggregate measurement\u2014either average latency across all packets (LDA) or per-\ufb02ow latency measurements (RLI). Network operators, however, need latency measurements at both \ufb01ner ( e.g. , packet) as well as \ufb02exible ( e.g. , \ufb02ow subsets) levels of granularity. To bridge this gap, we propose an architecture called MAPLE that essentially stores packet-level latencies in routers and allows network operators to query the latency of arbitrary traf\ufb01c sub-populations. MAPLE is built using scalable data structures with small storage needs (uses only 12.8 bits/pkt), and uses optimizations such as range queries to reduce the query bandwidth signi\ufb01cantly (by a factor of 10 compared to the naive)."
