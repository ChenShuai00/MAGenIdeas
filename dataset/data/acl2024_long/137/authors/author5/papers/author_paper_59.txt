    "title": "The Noncommutative bion core",
    "abstract": "We examine noncommutative solutions of the non-Abelian theory on the world-volume of N coincident D-strings. These solutions can be interpreted in terms of noncommutative geometry as funnels describing the non-Abelian D-string expanding out into an orthogonal D3-brane. These configurations are ``dual'' to the bion solutions in the Abelian world-volume theory of the D3-brane. In the latter, a charge N magnetic monopole describes N D-strings attached to the D3-brane with a spike deformation of the world volume. The noncommutative D-string solutions give a reliable account of physics at the core of the monopole, where the bion description is expected to break down. In the large N limit, we find good agreement between the two points of view, including the energy, couplings to background fields, and the shape of the funnel. We also study fluctuations traveling along the D-string, again obtaining agreement in the large N limit. At finite N, our results give a limit on the number of modes that can travel to infinity along the N D-strings attached to the D3-brane."
