    "title": "QuaRTz: An Open-Domain Dataset of Qualitative Relationship Questions",
    "abstract": "We introduce the first open-domain dataset, called QuaRTz, for reasoning about textual qualitative relationships. QuaRTz contains general qualitative statements, e.g., \u201cA sunscreen with a higher SPF protects the skin longer.\u201d, twinned with 3864 crowdsourced situated questions, e.g., \u201cBilly is wearing sunscreen with a lower SPF than Lucy. Who will be best protected from the sun?\u201d, plus annotations of the properties being compared. Unlike previous datasets, the general knowledge is textual and not tied to a fixed set of relationships, and tests a system\u2019s ability to comprehend and apply textual qualitative knowledge in a novel setting. We find state-of-the-art results are substantially (20%) below human performance, presenting an open challenge to the NLP community."
