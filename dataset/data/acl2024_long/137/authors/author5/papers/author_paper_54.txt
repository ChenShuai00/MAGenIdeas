    "title": "Superstars and giant gravitons",
    "abstract": "We examine a family of BPS solutions of ten-dimensional type-IIB supergravity. These solutions asymptotically approach AdS5 \u00d7 S5 and carry internal `angular' momentum on the five-sphere. While a naked singularity appears at the center of the anti-de Sitter space, we show that it has a natural physical interpretation in terms of a collection of giant gravitons. We calculate the distribution of giant gravitons from the dipole field induced in the Ramond-Ramond five-form, and show that these sources account for the entire internal momentum carried by the BPS solutions."
