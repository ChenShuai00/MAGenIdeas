    "title": "TorchMetrics - Measuring Reproducibility in PyTorch",
    "abstract": "A main problem with reproducing machine learning publications is the variance of metric implementations across papers. A lack of standardization leads to different behavior in mechanisms such as checkpointing, learning rate schedulers or early stopping, that will influence the reported results. For example, a complex metric such as Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID) for synthetic image quality evaluation (Heusel et al., 2017) will differ based on the specific interpolation method used."
