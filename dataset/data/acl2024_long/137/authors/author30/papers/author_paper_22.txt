    "title": "ViQA-COVID: COVID-19 Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset for Vietnamese",
    "abstract": "After two years of appearance, COVID-19 001 has negatively affected people and normal life 002 around the world. As in January 2022, there are 003 more than 317 million cases and five million 004 deaths worldwide (including nearly two mil- 005 lion cases and over thirty-four thousand deaths 006 in Vietnam). Economy and society are both 007 severely affected. The variant of COVID-19, 008 Omicron, has broken disease prevention mea- 009 sures of countries and rapidly increased number 010 of infections. Resources overloading in treat- 011 ment and epidemics prevention is happening all 012 over the world. It can be seen that, application 013 of artificial intelligence (AI) to support peo- 014 ple at this time is extremely necessary. There 015 have been many studies applying AI to pre- 016 vent COVID-19 which are extremely useful, 017 and studies on machine reading comprehension 018 (MRC) are also in it. Realizing that, we cre- 019 ated the first MRC dataset about COVID-19 for 020 Vietnamese: ViQA-COVID and can be used 021 to build models and systems, contributing to 022 disease prevention. Besides, ViQA-COVID is 023 also the first multi-span extraction MRC dataset 024 for Vietnamese, we hope that it can contribute 025 to promoting MRC studies in Vietnamese and 026 multilingual. We will publicly release ViQA- 027 COVID soon. 028"
