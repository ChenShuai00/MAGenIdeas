    "title": "LongChecker: Improving scientific claim verification by modeling full-abstract context",
    "abstract": "We introduce the L ONG C HECKER system for scienti\ufb01c claim veri\ufb01cation. Given a scienti\ufb01c claim and an evidence-containing research abstract, L ONG C HECKER predicts a veracity label and identi\ufb01es supporting rationales in a multitask fashion based on a shared encoding of the claim and abstract. We perform experiments on the S CI F ACT dataset, and \ufb01nd that L ONG C HECKER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We conduct analysis to understand the source of this improvement, and \ufb01nd that identifying the relationship between a claim and a rationale reporting a scienti\ufb01c \ufb01nding often requires understanding the context in which the rationale appears. By making labeling decisions based on all available context, L ONG C HECKER achieves better performance on cases requiring this type of understanding. In addition, we show that L ONG C HECKER is able to leverage weakly-supervised in-domain data to facilitate few-shot domain adaptation for scienti\ufb01c claim veri\ufb01cation. 1"
