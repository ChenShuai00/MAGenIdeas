    "title": "Toward Controlled Flight of the Ionocraft: A Flying Microrobot Using Electrohydrodynamic Thrust With Onboard Sensing and No Moving Parts",
    "abstract": "This letter presents an insect-scale microrobot that flies silently and with no mechanical moving parts, using a mechanism with no analogue in the natural world: electrohydrodynamic thrust produced by ions generated via corona discharge. For the first time, attitude and acceleration data are continuously collected from takeoff and sustained flight of a 2\u00a0cm <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula> 2\u00a0cm, 30\u00a0mg \u201cionocraft\u201d carrying a 37\u00a0mg 9-axis commercial IMU on FlexPCB payload, with external tethers for power and data transfer. The ionocraft's steady-state thrust versus voltage profile, dynamic response to a time-varying signal around a high voltage dc bias point, and aerodynamic drag at incident angles around 90 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> are measured. These experimental measurements, as well as measured IMU sensor noise, are inserted into a MATLAB Simulink simulation environment. Simulation shows controlled hovering and planned flight in arbitrary straight trajectories in the <italic>XY</italic> plane."
