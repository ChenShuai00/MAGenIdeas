    "abstract": "A wave of recent language models have been powered by large collections of natural language datasets. The sudden race to train models on these disparate collections of incorrectly, ambiguously, or under-documented datasets has left practitioners unsure of the legal and qualitative characteristics of the models they train. To remedy this crisis in data transparency and understanding, in a joint effort between experts in machine learning and the law, we\u2019ve compiled the most detailed and reliable metadata available for data licenses, sources, and provenance, as well as fine-grained characteristics like language, text domains, topics, usage, collection time, and task compositions. Beginning with nearly 40 popular instruction (or \u201calignment\u201d) tuning collections, we release a suite of open source tools for downloading, filtering, and examining this training data. Our analysis sheds light on the fractured state of data trans-parency, particularly with data licensing, and we hope our tools will empower more informed and responsible data-centric development of future language models."
