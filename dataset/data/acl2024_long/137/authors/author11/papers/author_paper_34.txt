    "title": "Style Variation as a Vantage Point for Code-Switching",
    "abstract": "Code-Switching (CS) is a common phenomenon observed in several bilingual and multilingual communities, thereby attaining prevalence in digital and social media platforms. This increasing prominence demands the need to model CS languages for critical downstream tasks. A major problem in this domain is the dearth of annotated data and a substantial corpora to train large scale neural models. Generating vast amounts of quality text assists several down stream tasks that heavily rely on language modeling such as speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis etc,. We present a novel vantage point of CS to be style variations between both the participating languages. Our approach does not need any external annotations such as lexical language ids. It mainly relies on easily obtainable monolingual corpora without any parallel alignment and a limited set of naturally CS sentences. We propose a two-stage generative adversarial training approach where the first stage generates competitive negative examples for CS and the second stage generates more realistic CS sentences. We present our experiments on the following pairs of languages: Spanish-English, Mandarin-English, Hindi-English and Arabic-French. We show that the trends in metrics for generated CS move closer to real CS data in each of the above language pairs through the dual stage training process. We believe this viewpoint of CS as style variations opens new perspectives for modeling various tasks in CS text."
