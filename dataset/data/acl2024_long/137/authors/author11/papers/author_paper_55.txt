    "title": "Establising Downclosure Property on Mining High Utility Frequent Itemsets From Large Databases",
    "abstract": "\u2014 \u2014 In today\u2019s world a vast amount of knowledge is stored in the web and database. Due to the availability of huge knowledge repositories, getting the relevant information is a challenging task and hence it must be mined and extracted. Association Rule Mining is one approach for extracting useful knowledge from database which includes frequent patterns and association rules between the items or attributes of a dataset with varying levels of strength. An efficient algorithm has been proposed to effectively prune the search space and efficiently capture all high utility itemsets with no miss. The challenge of utility mining is in restricting the size of the candidate itemset and simplifying the computation for calculating the utility. The existing up-growth algorithm reduces the no of candidate\u2019s item set but having complex strategies and not holding the downward closure property in up-tree. Here we use new algorithm to maintain downward closure property which is used in every FP-Tree and this algorithm removes complex strategies as well as reduces no of candidate itemset effectively. The new algorithm efficiently finds the high utility items. The main focus of this work is that a new Association Rule Mining has been proposed to enhance the capabilities of the existing Association Rule Mining algorithms in terms of the number of scans and memory utilization."
