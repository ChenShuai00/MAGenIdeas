    "abstract": "Natural language understanding models make 001 inferences using information from multiple 002 sources. An important class of such inferences 003 are those that require both background knowl-004 edge, presumably contained in a model\u2019s pre-005 trained parameters, and instance-specific in-006 formation that is supplied at inference time. 007 However, the integration and reasoning abili-008 ties of NLU models in the presence of multiple 009 knowledge sources have been largely under-010 studied. In this work, we propose a test suite 011 of coreference resolution tasks that require rea-012 soning over multiple facts and an accompany-013 ing dataset with individual subtasks that we 014 vary in order to control the knowledge source 015 of relevant facts. We evaluate state-of-the-art 016 coreference resolution models on our dataset. 017 Our results indicate that several models strug-018 gle to reason on-the-fly over knowledge ob-019 served both at train time and at inference time. 020 However, with task-specific training, a subset 021 of models demonstrates the ability to integrate 022 certain knowledge types from multiple sources. 023"
