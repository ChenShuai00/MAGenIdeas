    "title": "A Comparative Analysis of Popular Phylogenetic Reconstruction Algorithms",
    "abstract": "Understanding the evolutionary relationships between organisms by comparing their genomic sequences is a focus of modern-day computational biology research. Estimating evolutionary history in this way has many applications, particularly in analyzing the progression of infectious, viral diseases. Phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms model evolutionary history using tree-like structures that describe the estimated ancestry of a given set of species. Many methods exist to infer phylogenies from genes, but no one technique is definitively better for all types of sequences and organisms. Here, we implement and analyze several popular tree reconstruction methods and compare their effectiveness on both synthetic and real genomic sequences. Our synthetic data set aims to simulate a variety of research conditions, and includes inputs that vary in number of species. For our case-study, we use the genes of 53 apes and compare our reconstructions against the well-studied evolutionary history of primates. Though our implementations often represent the simplest manifestations of these complex methods, our results are suggestive of fundamental advantages and disadvantages that underlie each of these techniques."
