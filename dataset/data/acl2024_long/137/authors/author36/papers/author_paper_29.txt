    "title": "A Uni\ufb01ed Abstractive Model for Generating Question-Answer Pairs",
    "abstract": "Large-scale question-answer pairs (QAP) are 001 valuable for many applications, such as knowl-002 edge bases construction and machine reading 003 comprehension. Although its importance has 004 been widely recognized, existing approaches 005 are still faced with critical challenges. On 006 the one hand, QAPs are obtained by select-007 ing spans from original texts as their answers, 008 while abstractive answer generation is more 009 suitable and natural for complex QA appli-010 cations. On the other hand, the interaction 011 between the sub-tasks of answer generation 012 and question generation should be well cap-013 tured to enhance each other mutually. To 014 this end, we propose a Uni\ufb01ed Abstractive 015 model for Question-Answer Pairs generation 016 (UA-QAP). Speci\ufb01cally, we devise the joint 017 model with a query-guided gate to collectively 018 model the two sub-tasks simultaneously and 019 capture the interaction information between 020 them. Therefore, our model can generate 021 semantically comprehensive question-answer 022 pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on 023 three large-scale datasets. The experimental 024 results demonstrate that our model achieves 025 state-of-the-art performance. 026"
