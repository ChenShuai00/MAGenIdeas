    "title": "A Comprehensive Evaluation of Biomedical Entity Linking and Normalization Models",
    "abstract": "Biomedical entity linking (BioEL) is the pro-001 cess of connecting entities referenced in doc-002 uments to entries in biomedical databases 003 such as the Unified Medical Language System 004 (UMLS) or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). 005 The study objective was to comprehensively 006 evaluate nine recent state-of-the-art biomedical 007 entity linking models under a unified frame-008 work. We compare these models along axes of 009 (1) accuracy, (2) speed, (3) ease of use, (4) gen-010 eralization, and (5) adaptability to new ontolo-011 gies and datasets. We additionally quantify the 012 impact of various preprocessing choices such as 013 abbreviation detection. Systematic evaluation 014 reveals several notable gaps in current meth-015 ods. In particular, current methods struggle 016 to correctly link genes and proteins and often 017 have difficulty effectively incorporating context 018 into linking decisions. To expedite future de-019 velopment and baseline testing, we release our 020 unified evaluation framework and all included 021 models in our linked github repo (added upon 022 publication). 023"
