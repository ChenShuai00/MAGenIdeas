    "title": "sciDataQA: Scientific Dataset Recommendation for Question Answering",
    "abstract": "In order to advance scientific discovery, it is 001 essential to answer scientific questions regard-002 ing a particular field of study. However, these 003 questions might not be answered easily with 004 just a few words and might mislead scientists, 005 delaying scientific discovery. In this paper, we 006 propose to recommend scientific datasets in-007 stead of directly answering each question. We 008 introduce sciDataQA, a novel scientific dataset 009 recommendation dataset with 43466 scientific 010 datasets and 244128 questions, including each 011 dataset\u2019s title, citation information, summary, 012 and abstract. We construct the dataset with 013 large pre-trained language models and utilize 014 a contrastive-learning-based approach to fil-015 ter the low-quality questions. Based on this 016 dataset, we develop a novel recursive retrieval 017 approach for scientific dataset recommendation. 018 Further, we illustrate how our dataset can be 019 used to study citation prediction and improve 020 existing scientific QA systems. Extensive ex-021 periments show the effectiveness of our recur-022 sive retrieval approach and the improvement in 023 the low-resource setting of two existing scien-024 tific QA systems with our dataset. 025"
