    "abstract": "Huddleston and Pullum (2002) (H&P) pro-001 vides an 1842 page description of the gram-002 mar of English. We analysed the top 75 1 ci-003 tations to H&P from the ACL Anthology. The 004 community has indeed produced work that is 005 strongly in\ufb02uenced by H&P, especially in lin-006 guistically challenging areas such as deixis, 007 anaphora and negation. To illustrate the po-008 tential of H&P as source material for linguis-009 tically informed error analysis in a conceptu-010 ally complex domain, we extract the examples 011 from chapter 17 of H&P (Stirling and Hud-012 dleston, 2002), which deals with deixis and 013 anaphora. We show how a representative mod-014 ern co-reference engine (Clark and Manning, 015 2016a,b) handles these examples. Since every 016 example in H&P is chosen to illustrate a point 017 about English, and the authors provide text ex-018 plaining the importance of the point, the error 019 analyst has immediate access to a good proxy 020 for relevant linguistic expertise. 021"
