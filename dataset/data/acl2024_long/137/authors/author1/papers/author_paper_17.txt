    "abstract": "Describing terminologies with definition texts 001 is an important step towards understanding 002 the scientific literature, especially for domains 003 with limited labeled terminologies. Previous 004 works have sought to design supervised neural 005 text generation models to solve the biomedi-006 cal terminology generation task, but most of 007 them failed to define never-before-seen termi-008 nologies in newly emerging research fields. 009 Here, we tackle this challenge by introducing 010 a zero-shot definition generation model based 011 on prompting , a recent approach for eliciting 012 knowledge from pre-trained language models, 013 with automatically generated prompts. Fur-014 thermore, we enhanced the biomedical termi-015 nology dataset by adding descriptive texts to 016 each biomedical subdiscipline, thus enabling 017 zero-shot learning scenarios. Our model out-018 performed existing supervised baseline and the 019 baseline pre-trained language model that em-020 ploys manually crafted prompts by up to 52 and 021 6 BLEU score, respectively. 022"
