    "title": "AdvEntuRe: Adversarial Training for Textual Entailment with Knowledge-Guided Examples",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning textual entailment models with limited supervision (5K-10K training examples), and present two complementary approaches for it. First, we propose knowledge-guided adversarial example generators for incorporating large lexical resources in entailment models via only a handful of rule templates. Second, to make the entailment model\u2014a discriminator\u2014more robust, we propose the first GAN-style approach for training it using a natural language example generator that iteratively adjusts to the discriminator\u2019s weaknesses. We demonstrate effectiveness using two entailment datasets, where the proposed methods increase accuracy by 4.7% on SciTail and by 2.8% on a 1% sub-sample of SNLI. Notably, even a single hand-written rule, negate, improves the accuracy of negation examples in SNLI by 6.1%."
