    "title": "SynerGPT: In-Context Learning for Personalized Drug Synergy Prediction and Drug Design",
    "abstract": "Predicting synergistic drug combinations can help accelerate discovery of cancer treatments, particularly therapies personalized to a patient\u2019s specific tumor via biopsied cells. In this paper, we propose a novel setting and models for in-context drug synergy learning. We are given a small \u201cpersonalized dataset\u201d of 10-20 drug synergy relationships in the context of specific cancer cell targets. Our goal is to predict additional drug synergy relationships in that context. Inspired by recent work that pre-trains a GPT language model (LM) to \u201cin-context learn\u201d common function classes, we devise novel pre-training schemes that enable a GPT model to in-context learn \u201cdrug synergy functions\u201d. Our model\u2014which does not use any textual corpora, molecular fingerprints, protein interaction or any other domain-specific knowledge\u2014 is able to achieve competitive results. We further integrate our in-context approach with a genetic algorithm to optimize model prompts and select synergy candidates to test after conducting a patient biopsy. Finally, we explore a novel task of inverse drug design which can potentially enable the design of drugs that synergize specifically to target a given patient\u2019s \u201cpersonalized dataset\u201d. Our findings can potentially have an important impact on precision cancer medicine, and also raise intriguing questions on non-textual pre-training for LMs."
