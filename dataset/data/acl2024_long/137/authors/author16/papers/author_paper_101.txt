    "abstract": "Accelarating Imitation Learning in Relational Domains via Transfer by Initialization Report Title The problem of learning to mimic a human expert/teacher from training trajectories is called imitation learning. To make the process of teaching easier in this setting, we propose to employ transfer learning (where one learns on a source problem and transfers the knowledge to potentially more complex target problems). We consider multirelational environments such as real-time strategy games and use functional-gradient boosting to capture and transfer the models learned in these environments. Our experiments demonstrate that our learner learns a very good initial model from the simple scenario and effectively transfers the knowledge to the more complex scenario thus achieving a jump start, a steeper learning curve and a higher convergence in performance.
