    "title": "NEWSFARM: the Largest Chinese Corpus for Long News Summarization Anonymous ACL submission",
    "abstract": "Recently, driven by a large number of datasets, 001 the \ufb01eld of natural language processing(NLP) 002 has developed rapidly. However, the lack of 003 large-scale and high-quality Chinese datasets 004 is still a critical bottleneck for further research 005 on automatic text summarization. To close 006 this gap, we searched Chinese news websites 007 of domestic and abroad media, designed the 008 algorithm HSS (hidden topic, semantic, and 009 syntactic) to crawl and \ufb01lter these records to 010 construct NEWSFARM . NEWSFARM is the 011 largest highest quality Chinese long news sum-012 marization corpus, containing more than 200K 013 Chinese long news and summaries written by 014 professional editors or authors, which are all 015 released to the public. Based on the corpus, 016 we calculated the static metrics and designed 017 many experiments with the baseline models. 018 By comparing with the common datasets, the 019 experiment results show that the high quality 020 of our dataset and training effect of the mod-021 els, which not only demonstrates the useful-022 ness and challenges of the proposed corpus 023 for automatic text summarization but also pro-024 vides a benchmark for further research. 025"
