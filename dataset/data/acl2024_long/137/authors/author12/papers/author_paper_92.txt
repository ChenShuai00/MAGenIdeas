    "title": "Identifying Significance of Discrepancies in Radiology Reports",
    "abstract": "At many teaching hospitals, it is common practice for on-call radiology residents to interpret radiology examinations; such reports are later reviewed and revised by an attending physician before being used for any decision making. In case there are substantial problems in the resident\u2019s initial report, the resident is called and the problems are reviewed to prevent similar future reporting errors. However, due to the large volume of reports produced, attending physicians rarely discuss the problems side by side with residents, thus missing an educational opportunity. In this work, we introduce a pipeline to discriminate between reports with significant discrepancies and those with non-significant discrepancies. The former contain severe errors or mis-interpretations, thus representing a great learning opportunity for the resident; the latter presents only minor differences (often stylistic) and have a minor role in the education of a resident. By discriminating between the two, the proposed system could flag those reports that an attending radiology should definitely review with residents under their supervision. We evaluated our approach on 350 manually annotated radiology reports sampled from a collection of tens of thousands. The proposed classifier achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.837, which represent a 14% improvement over the baselines. Furthermore, the classifier reduces the False Negative Rate (FNR) by 52%, a desirable performance metric for any recall-oriented task such as the one studied"
