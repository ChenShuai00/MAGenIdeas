    "title": "Challenges in Automated Question Answering for Privacy Policies",
    "abstract": "Privacy policies are legal documents used to inform users about the collection and handling of their data services or technologies with which they interact. Research has shown that few users take the time to read these policies, as they are often long and difficult to understand. In addition, users often only care about a small subset of issues discussed in privacy policies, and some of the issues they actually care about may not even be addressed in the text of the policies. Rather than requiring users to read the policies, a better approach might be to allow them to simply ask questions about those issues they care about, possibly through iterative dialog. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by exploring the idea of an automated privacy question-answering assistant, and look at the kinds of questions users are likely to pose to such a system. This analysis is informed by an initial study that elicits privacy questions from crowdworkers about the data practices of mobile apps. We analyze 1350 questions posed by crowdworkers about the privacy practices of a diverse cross section of mobile applications. This analysis sheds some light on privacy issues mobile app users are likely to inquire about as well as their ability to articulate questions in this domain. Our findings in turn should help inform the design of future privacy question answering systems."
