    "title": "Lumos: Learning Agents with Unified Data, Modular Design, and Open-Source LLMs",
    "abstract": "We introduce L UMOS , a novel framework for training l anguage agents that employs a u nified data format and a m odular architecture based on open-source large language models (LLMs). L UMOS consists of three distinct modules: planning, grounding, and execution. The planning module breaks down a task into a series of high-level, tool-agnostic subgoals, which are then made specific by the grounding module through a set of low-level actions. These actions are subsequently executed by the execution module , utilizing a range of off-the-shelf tools and APIs. In order to train these modules effectively, high-quality annotations of subgoals and actions were collected and are made available for fine-tuning open-source LLMs for various tasks such as complex question answering, web tasks, and math problems. Leveraging this unified data and modular design, L UMOS not only achieves comparable or superior performance to current, state-of-the-art agents, but also exhibits several key advantages: (1) L UMOS surpasses GPT-4/3.5-based agents in complex question answering and web tasks, while equalling the performance of significantly larger LLM agents on math tasks; (2) L UMOS out-performs open-source agents created through conventional training methods and those using chain-of-thoughts training; and (3) L UMOS is capable of effectively generalizing to unseen interactive tasks, outperforming larger LLM-based agents and even exceeding performance of specialized agents."
