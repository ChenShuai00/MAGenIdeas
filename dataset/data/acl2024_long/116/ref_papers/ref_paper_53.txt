    "title": "Neural Generation of Regular Expressions from Natural Language with Minimal Domain Knowledge",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the task of translating natural language queries into regular expressions which embody their meaning. In contrast to prior work, the proposed neural model does not utilize domain-specific crafting, learning to translate directly from a parallel corpus. To fully explore the potential of neural models, we propose a methodology for collecting a large corpus of regular expression, natural language pairs. Our resulting model achieves a performance gain of 19.6% over previous state-of-the-art models."
