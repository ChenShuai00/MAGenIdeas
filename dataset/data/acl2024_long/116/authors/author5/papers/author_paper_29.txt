    "title": "Learning First-Order Rules with Relational Path Contrast for Inductive Relation Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Relation reasoning in knowledge graphs (KGs) aims at predicting missing relations in incomplete triples, whereas the dominant paradigm is learning the embeddings of relations and entities, which is limited to a transductive setting and has restriction on processing unseen entities in an inductive situation. Previous inductive methods are scalable and consume less resource. They utilize the structure of entities and triples in subgraphs to own inductive ability. However, in order to obtain better reasoning results, the model should acquire entity-independent relational semantics in latent rules and solve the deficient supervision caused by scarcity of rules in subgraphs. To address these issues, we propose a novel graph convolutional network (GCN)-based approach for interpretable inductive reasoning with relational path contrast, named RPC-IR. RPC-IR firstly extracts relational paths between two entities and learns representations of them, and then innovatively introduces a contrastive strategy by constructing positive and negative relational paths. A joint training strategy considering both supervised and contrastive information is also proposed. Comprehensive experiments on three inductive datasets show that RPC-IR achieves outstanding performance comparing with the latest inductive reasoning methods and could explicitly represent logical rules for interpretability."
