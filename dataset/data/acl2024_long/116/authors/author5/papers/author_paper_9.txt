    "title": "Recommending Learning Objects Through Attentive Heterogeneous Graph Convolution and Operation-Aware Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have received unprecedented attention, in which learners can obtain a large number of learning objects anytime and anywhere. However, the increasing information overload on MOOCs inhibits the appropriate choice of learning objects by learners, leading to a low efficiency and high dropout rates in the learning process of this human-computer interaction scenario. E-learning recommendation systems have been studied to present learning objects directly to learners, thereby relieving such problem. However, in MOOC platforms, recommendation network structures which can selectively extract implicit feature such as heterogeneous learning preference and knowledge organization of learning objects are still not comprehensively studied. To this end, we propose a learning object recommendation model based on heterogeneous learning behavior and knowledge graph. To generate a unified representation of each entity and relation, we first propose an Attentive Composition based Graph Convolutional Network (ACGCN). By introducing an attention mechanism, information is amplified when updating the representation of the heterogeneous graph, which eliminates the impact of noise and improves the robustness of the model. Then, a Dense Feature based Operation-Aware Network (DFOAN) is utilized to capture implicit and complex learners\u2019 interactive behaviors, and to further provide a recommendation. Experimental results using two real-world datasets revealed that our proposed model has the best precision, recall, F1, and accuracy scores compared to those of several existing models."
