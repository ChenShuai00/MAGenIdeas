    "title": "Multimodal Filtering of Social Media for Temporal Monitoring and Event Analysis",
    "abstract": "Developing an efficient and effective social media monitoring system has become one of the important steps towards improved public safety. With the explosive availability of user-generated content documenting most conflicts and human rights abuses around the world, analysts and first-responders increasingly find themselves overwhelmed with massive amounts of noisy data from social media. In this paper, we construct a large-scale public safety event dataset with retrospective automatic labeling for 4.2 million multimodal tweets from 7 public safety events occurred in 2013~2017. We propose a new multimodal social media filtering system composed of encoding, classification, and correlation networks to jointly learn shared and complementary visual and textual information to filter out the most relevant and useful items among the noisy social media influx. The proposed model is verified and achieves significant improvement over competitive baselines under the retrospective and real-time experimental protocols."
