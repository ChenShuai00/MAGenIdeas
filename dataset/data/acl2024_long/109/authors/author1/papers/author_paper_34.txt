    "abstract": "In this section of the notebook, we present our system in the TRECVID Video to Text description generation task. The optimization target is critical to train the encoder-decoder based video captioning models. However, there are two main limitations of the most widely used cross-entropy (CE) function as the training target, namely exposure bias and mismatched targets in training and testing. Therefore, we propose to utilize the reinforcement-learning algorithm with different rewards to improve the video captioning performance, which has achieved substantial gains over the CE-trained baselines."
