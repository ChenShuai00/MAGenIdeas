    "title": "SpeechCLIP: Integrating Speech with Pre-Trained Vision and Language Model",
    "abstract": "Data-driven speech processing models usually perform well with a large amount of text supervision, but collecting transcribed speech data is costly. Therefore, we propose Speech-CLIP, a novel framework bridging speech and text through images to enhance speech models without transcriptions. We leverage state-of-the-art pre-trained HuBERT and CLIP, aligning them via paired images and spoken captions with minimal fine-tuning. SpeechCLIP outperforms prior state-of-the-art on image-speech retrieval and performs zero-shot speech-text retrieval without direct supervision from transcriptions. Moreover, SpeechCLIP can directly retrieve semantically related keywords from speech."
