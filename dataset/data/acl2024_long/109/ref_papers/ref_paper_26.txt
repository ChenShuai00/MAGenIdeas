    "title": "Phonemizer: Text to Phones Transcription for Multiple Languages in Python",
    "abstract": "Phones are elementary sounds the speech is made of, on which syllables and words are built. The transcription of texts from their orthographic form into a phonetic alphabet is an important requirement in various applications related to speech and language processing, for instance for text to speech systems. Phonemizer is a Python package addressing precisely this issue: it transcribes a text from its orthographic representation into a phonetic one. The package is user-friendly and exposes a single high-level phonemize function, a lower lovel API, and is also available as a command-line interface. It supports about a hundred different languages and provides end-user functionalities such as punctuation preservation, phones accentuation, tokenization at phone/syllable/word levels, as well as parallel processing of large input texts."
