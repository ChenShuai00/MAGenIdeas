    "title": "PromptStyle: Controllable Style Transfer for Text-to-Speech with Natural Language Descriptions",
    "abstract": "Style transfer TTS has shown impressive performance in recent years. However, style control is often restricted to systems built on expressive speech recordings with discrete style categories. In practical situations, users may be interested in transferring style by typing text descriptions of desired styles, without the reference speech in the target style. The text-guided content generation techniques have drawn wide attention recently. In this work, we explore the possibility of controllable style transfer with natural language descriptions. To this end, we propose PromptStyle, a text prompt-guided cross-speaker style transfer system. Specifically, PromptStyle consists of an improved VITS and a cross-modal style encoder. The cross-modal style encoder constructs a shared space of stylistic and semantic representation through a two-stage training process. Experiments show that PromptStyle can achieve proper style transfer with text prompts while maintaining relatively high stability and speaker similarity. Audio samples are available in our demo page."
