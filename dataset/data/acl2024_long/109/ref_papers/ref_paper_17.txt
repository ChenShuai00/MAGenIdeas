    "title": "SingSong: Generating musical accompaniments from singing",
    "abstract": "We present SingSong , a system that generates instrumental music to accompany input vocals, potentially offering musicians and non-musicians alike an intuitive new way to create music featuring their own voice. To accomplish this, we build on recent developments in musical source separation and audio generation. Speci\ufb01cally, we apply a state-of-the-art source separation algorithm to a large corpus of music audio to produce aligned pairs of vocals and instrumental sources. Then, we adapt AudioLM (Borsos et al., 2022)\u2014a state-of-the-art approach for unconditional audio generation\u2014to be suitable for conditional \u201caudio-to-audio\u201d generation tasks, and train it on the source-separated (vocal, instrumental) pairs. In a pairwise comparison with the same vocal inputs, listeners expressed a signi\ufb01cant preference for instrumentals generated by SingSong compared to those from a strong retrieval baseline."
