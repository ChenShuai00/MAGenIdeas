    "title": "Regulating the Electronic Synergy of Asymmetric Atomic Fe Sites with Adjacent Defects for Boosting Activity and Durability toward Oxygen Reduction",
    "abstract": "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a fundamental role in sustainable energy technologies. However, the creation of non\u2010precious metal electrocatalysts with high ORR activity and durability under all pH conditions is of great significance but remains challenging. Herein, the aim is to overcome this challenge by creating a Fe single atom catalyst on a 2D defect\u2010containing nitrogen\u2010doped carbon support (Fe1/DNC) via a microenvironment engineering strategy. Microkinetic modeling reveals that FeN4(OH) moieties are the real active sites under reaction conditions. Due to the synergistic promotion effect of denser accessible FeN4(OH) moieties and defect\u2010induced electronic properties, Fe1/DNC catalyst achieves extraordinary ORR activity under alkaline, acidic, and neutral conditions, with half\u2010wave potentials of 0.95, 0.82, and 0.70\u00a0V, respectively. Moreover, a negligible performance decay is observed with this Fe catalyst in stability and methanol tolerance tests. Zn\u2010air battery employing Fe1/DNC delivers remarkable peak power density and long\u2010term operational durability. Theoretical analysis provides compelling evidence that the defects adjacent to FeN4(OH) moieties can endow an inductive effect to reshape electronic properties to balance the OOH* formation and OH* reduction. This work offers insight into the regulation of asymmetric coordination structure and electronic properties of metal sites for boosting electrocatalytic activity and stability."
