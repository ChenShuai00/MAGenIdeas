    "title": "A Neural Approach to KGQA via SPARQL Silhouette Generation",
    "abstract": "Semantic parsing is a predominant approach 001 to solve the Knowledge Graph Question An-002 swering (KGQA) task where, natural language 003 question is translated into a logic form such 004 as SPARQL. Semantic parsing based solutions 005 are mostly modular/pipelined where, noise 006 introduced by the upstream modules for en-007 tity/relation linking makes it hard to solve 008 the complex questions. Recently, Neural Ma-009 chine Translation (NMT) based approaches 010 have emerged that are capable of handling 011 complex questions. However, NMT-based ap-012 proaches struggle with handling the large num-013 ber of test entities and relations that are un-014 seen during training. In this work,we propose 015 a modular two-stage neural approach which 016 combines best of both the worlds - NMT and 017 semantic parsing pipeline. Stage-I of our ap-018 proach comprises an NMT-based seq2seq mod-019 ule that translates a question into a sketch of 020 the desired SPARQL, called as SPARQL sil-021 houette. This stage also contains a noise sim-022 ulator which combines the masking scheme 023 with an entity/relation linker in a novel manner 024 so as to take care of unseen entities/relation 025 without blowing up the vocabulary of seq2seq 026 module. Stage-II of our approach comprises 027 a Neural Graph Search (NGS) module which 028 aims to distil the SPARQL silhouette in order 029 to reduce the entity/relation linking noise. Ex-030 perimental results show that, the quality of gen-031 erated SPARQL silhouette is impressive for an 032 ideal scenario where entity/relation linker is 033 noise-free. For the realistic scenario (i.e. noisy 034 linker), the quality of the SPARQL silhouette 035 drops but our NGS module recovers it consider-036 ably. We show that"
