    "title": "Unsupervised Neural Categorization for Scientific Publications",
    "abstract": "Most conventional document categorization methods require a large number of documents with labeled categories for training. These methods are hard to be applied in scenarios, such as scientific publications, where training data is expensive to obtain and categories could change over years and across domains. In this work, we propose UNEC, an unsupervised representation learning model that directly categories documents without the need of labeled training data. Specifically, we develop a novel cascade embedding approach. We first embed concepts, i.e., significant phrases mined from scientific publications, into continuous vectors, which capture concept semantics. Based on the concept similarity graph built from the concept embedding, we further embed concepts into a hidden category space, where the category information of concepts becomes explicit. Finally we categorize documents by jointly considering the category attribution of their concepts. Our experimental results show that UNEC significantly outperforms several strong baselines on a number of real scientific corpora, under both automatic and manual evaluation."
