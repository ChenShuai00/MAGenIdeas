    "title": "Fast Eye-in-Hand 3-D Scanner-Robot Calibration for Low Stitching Errors",
    "abstract": "This article proposes a new eye-in-hand 3-D scanner-robot calibration approach to realize low data stitching errors during long-term continuous measurement. Eye-in-hand 3-D scanner\u2013robot systems are commonly used for the complete measurement of an object under test (OUT) from multiple fields of view (FOVs). To align the multiple FOVs into a single coordinate system, marker-free stitching assisted by robot's positioning is attractive since it bypasses the cumbersome traditional fiducial marker-based method. Based on periodically capturing calibration images from a 2-D calibration target, scanner's and robot kinematic model's parameters are optimized. The challenges overcome in this article include: how to compensate for the center-detection error in scanner calibration; how to avoid the dependence of hand-eye calibration on DH parameters; and how to calculate an accurate world-to-robot transformation. These challenges were tackled by several new techniques including accurate scanner calibration with iterative refinement of control points, virtual arm-based scanner-robot kinematic modeling, and trajectory-based world-to-robot transformation calculation. Experimental results demonstrated a low-initial stitching error similar to the fiducial marker-based method (0.0446\u00a0mm versus 0.0542\u00a0mm) was achieved. The mean stitching error was effectively maintained to be $< $0.1\u00a0mm during the continuous measurement with an average intermittent downtime of 78 s for recalibration."
