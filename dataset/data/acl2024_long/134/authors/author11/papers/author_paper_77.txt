    "title": "An Empirical Study on Cross-Lingual and Cross-Domain Transfer for Legal Judgment Prediction",
    "abstract": "Cross-lingual transfer learning has proven use-001 ful in a variety of NLP tasks, but it is under-002 studied in the context of legal NLP, and not at 003 all on Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP). We ex-004 plore transfer learning techniques on LJP using 005 the trilingual Swiss-Judgment-Prediction (SJP) 006 dataset, including cases written in three lan-007 guages (German, French, Italian). We find 008 that Cross-Lingual Transfer (CLT) improves 009 the overall results across languages, especially 010 when we augment the dataset with machine-011 translated versions of the original documents, 012 using a 3 \u00d7 larger training corpus. Further on, 013 we perform an analysis exploring the effect of 014 cross-domain and cross-regional transfer, i.e., 015 train a model across domains (legal areas), or 016 regions. We find that in both settings (legal 017 areas, origin regions), models trained across 018 all groups perform overall better, while they 019 also have improved results in the worst-case 020 scenarios. Finally, we report improved results 021 when we ambitiously apply cross-jurisdiction 022 transfer, where we augment our dataset with 023 Indian legal cases originally written in English. 024"
