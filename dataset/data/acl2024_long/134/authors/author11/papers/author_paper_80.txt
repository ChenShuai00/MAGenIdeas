    "abstract": "Given the growing number of scienti\ufb01c pa-001 pers, automatic information extraction in sci-002 enti\ufb01c documents is important for ef\ufb01cient 003 knowledge update and discovery. A key com-004 ponent in scienti\ufb01c papers involves rhetor-005 ical activities/events to convey new knowl-006 edge and convince readers of the correctness. 007 This work explores a new information extrac-008 tion problem for scienti\ufb01c documents, aim-009 ing to identify event trigger words of rhetori-010 cal events/activities, i.e., event detection (ED). 011 To promote future research in this area, we 012 present SciEvent, the \ufb01rst and new dataset for 013 event detection in scienti\ufb01c documents. Sci-014 Event annotates scienti\ufb01c papers of four dif-015 ferent domains (i.e., computer science, biol-016 ogy, physics, and mathematics) using 8 pop-017 ular event types. Our experiments on SciEvent 018 demonstrate the challenges of scienti\ufb01c ED for 019 existing models and call for further research ef-020 fort in this area. We will publicly release Sci-021 Event to facilitate future research. 022"
