    "title": "Event Detection via Derangement Reading Comprehension",
    "abstract": "Event detection (ED), aiming to detect events 001 from texts and categorize them, is vital to 002 understanding the actual happenings in real 003 life. Recently, ED without triggers has been 004 proposed and gained bene\ufb01ts since it relieves 005 the tedious effort of data labeling. However, 006 it still suffers from several formidable chal-007 lenges: multi-label, insuf\ufb01cient clues, and im-008 balanced event types. We, therefore, propose a 009 novel Derangement mechanism on a machine 010 Reading Comprehension (DRC) framework to 011 tackle the above challenges. More specially, 012 we treat the input text as Context and concate-013 nate it with all event types that are deemed 014 as Answers with an omitted default question. 015 Thus, by appending input text and event types 016 simultaneously, we can facilitate the power of 017 self-attention in pre-trained language models, 018 e.g., BERT, to absorb the semantic relation 019 among them. Moreover, we design a simple 020 yet effective derangement mechanism to re-021 lieve the imbalanced training. By introducing 022 such perturbation mainly on major events, we 023 can prohibit major events from excessive learn-024 ing or implicitly under-sample the instances 025 of the major events. This yields a more bal-026 anced training to resolve the imbalanced learn-027 ing issue. The empirical results show that: 028 (1) our proposed framework attains state-of-029 the-art performance over previous competitive 030 models, and (2) by-product, our model can sig-031 nify the connection of triggers and arguments 032 to events for further analysis. 033"
