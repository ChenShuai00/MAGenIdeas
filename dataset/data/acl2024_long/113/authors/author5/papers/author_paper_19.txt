    "title": "What Is Missing in Multilingual Visual Reasoning and How to Fix It",
    "abstract": "NLP models today strive for supporting multiple languages and modalities, improving accessibility for diverse users. In this paper, we evaluate their multilingual, multimodal capabilities by testing on a visual reasoning task. We observe that proprietary systems like GPT-4V obtain the best performance on this task now, but open models lag in comparison. Surprisingly, GPT-4V exhibits similar performance between English and other languages, indicating the potential for equitable system development across languages. Our analysis on model failures reveals three key aspects that make this task challenging: multilinguality, complex reasoning, and multimodality. To address these challenges, we propose three targeted interventions including a translate-test approach to tackle multilinguality, a visual programming approach to break down complex reasoning, and a novel method that leverages image captioning to address multimodality. Our interventions achieve the best open performance on this task in a zero-shot setting, boosting open model LLaVA by 13.4%, while also minorly improving GPT-4V's performance."
