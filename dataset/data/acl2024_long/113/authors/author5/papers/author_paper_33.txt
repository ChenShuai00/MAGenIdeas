    "abstract": "Multilingual pre-trained language models 001 (mPLMs) have achieved great success on vari-002 ous cross-lingual tasks. However, we find that 003 the higher performance on these tasks cannot 004 be regarded as the better cross-lingual ability 005 because models\u2019 task-specific abilities can also 006 influence the performance. In this work, we do 007 a comprehensive study on two representative 008 cross-lingual evaluation protocols: sentence re-009 trieval and zero-shot transfer. We find that cur-010 rent cross-lingual evaluation results strongly 011 depend on mPLMs\u2019 task-specific abilities so 012 that the performance can be improved with-013 out any improvement in models\u2019 cross-lingual 014 ability. To have more accurate comparisons 015 of cross-lingual ability between mPLMs, we 016 propose two new indexes based on the two eval-017 uation protocols: calibrated sentence retrieval 018 performance and transfer rate, and experimen-019 tally show that our proposed indexes effectively 020 eliminate the effects of task-specific abilities 021 on the cross-lingual evaluation. 022"
