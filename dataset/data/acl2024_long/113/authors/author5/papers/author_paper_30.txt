    "abstract": "Quantifying linguistic diversity in multilingual 001 data sets is important for improving cross-002 linguistic coverage of NLP models. How-003 ever, current linguistic diversity scores rely 004 mostly on measures such as the number of 005 languages in the sample, which are not very 006 informative about the structural properties of 007 languages. In this paper, we propose a score 008 derived from the distribution of text statis-009 tics (mean word length) as a linguistic at-010 tribute suitable for cross-linguistic comparison. 011 We compare NLP data sets (UD, Bible100. 012 mBERT, XTREME, XGLUE, XNLI, XCOPA, 013 TyDiQA, XQuAD) to a new data set designed 014 speci\ufb01cally for the purpose of being typologi-015 cally representative (WALS-SC). To do so, we 016 apply a version of the Jaccard index ( J mm ) 017 suitable for comparing sets of measures. This 018 diversity score can identify the types of lan-019 guages that need to be included in multilin-020 gual data sets in order to reach broad lin-021 guistic coverage. We \ufb01nd, for example, that 022 (poly)synthetic languages are missing in al-023 most all data sets. 024"
