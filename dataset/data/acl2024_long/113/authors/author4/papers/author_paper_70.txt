    "abstract": "Transformer-based language model ap-001 proaches to automated story generation 002 currently provide state-of-the-art results. 003 However, they still suffer from plot incoher-004 ence when generating narratives over time, 005 and critically lack basic commonsense reason-006 ing. Furthermore, existing methods generally 007 focus only on single-character stories, or fail 008 to track characters at all. To improve the co-009 herence of generated narratives and to expand 010 the scope of character-centric narrative gener-011 ation, we introduce Commonsense-inference 012 Augmented neural StoryTelling (CAST), a 013 framework for introducing commonsense 014 reasoning into the generation process while 015 modeling the interaction between multiple 016 characters. We \ufb01nd that our CAST method 017 produces signi\ufb01cantly more coherent and 018 on-topic two-character stories, outperforming 019 baselines in dimensions including plot plausi-020 bility and staying on topic. We also show how 021 the CAST method can be used to further train 022 language models that generate more coherent 023 stories and reduce computation cost. 024"
