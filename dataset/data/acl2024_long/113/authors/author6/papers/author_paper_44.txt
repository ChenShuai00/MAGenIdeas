    "abstract": "Commonsense knowledge is critical to achiev-001 ing artificial general intelligence. Large lan-002 guage models have demonstrated impressive 003 performance on commonsense tasks, however 004 these tasks are often posed as multiple-choice 005 questions, allowing models to exploit system-006 atic biases (Li et al., 2021). Commonsense is 007 also inherently probabilistic; a plumber could 008 repair a sink in a kitchen or a bathroom, or even 009 a basement, although the former answers are 010 more probable. Existing tasks do not capture 011 the probabilistic nature of common sense. To 012 this end we present commonsense frame com-013 pletion (CFC), a new generative task which 014 evaluates common sense via multiple open-015 ended generations. We also propose a method 016 of probabilistic evaluation which strongly cor-017 relates with human judgements. Humans dras-018 tically outperform strong language model base-019 lines on our dataset, indicating this approach 020 is both a challenging and useful evaluation of 021 machine common sense. 022"
