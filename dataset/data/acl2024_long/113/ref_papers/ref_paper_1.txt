    "abstract": "Abstract Culture fundamentally shapes people\u2019s reasoning, behavior, and communication. As people increasingly use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite and automate personal and professional tasks, cultural values embedded in AI models may bias people\u2019s authentic expression and contribute to the dominance of certain cultures. We conduct a disaggregated evaluation of cultural bias for five widely used large language models (OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o/4-turbo/4/3.5-turbo/3) by comparing the models\u2019 responses to nationally representative survey data. All models exhibit cultural values resembling English-speaking and Protestant European countries. We test cultural prompting as a control strategy to increase cultural alignment for each country/territory. For later models (GPT-4, 4-turbo, 4o), this improves the cultural alignment of the models\u2019 output for 71\u201381% of countries and territories. We suggest using cultural prompting and ongoing evaluation to reduce cultural bias in the output of generative AI."
