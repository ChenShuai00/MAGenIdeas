    "title": "Taming Data and Transformers for Audio Generation",
    "abstract": "Generating ambient sounds is a challenging task due to data scarcity and often insufficient caption quality, making it difficult to employ large-scale generative models for the task. In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing two new models. First, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality and efficient automatic audio captioning model. By using a compact audio representation and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of 83.2, marking a 3.2% improvement from the best available captioning model at four times faster inference speed. Second, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. Using AutoCap to generate caption clips from existing audio datasets, we demonstrate the benefits of data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to state-of-the-art audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of 4.7% in FAD score, 22.7% in IS, and 13.5% in CLAP score, indicating significantly improved quality of generated audio compared to previous works. Moreover, we propose an efficient and scalable pipeline for collecting audio datasets, enabling us to compile 57M ambient audio clips, forming AutoReCap-XL, the largest available audio-text dataset, at 90 times the scale of existing ones. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available."
