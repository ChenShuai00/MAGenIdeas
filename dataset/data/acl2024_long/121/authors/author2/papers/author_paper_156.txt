    "title": "Combining Biometric Scores in Identification Systems",
    "abstract": "Combination approaches in biometric identification system usually consider only the matching scores related to a single person in order to derive a combine d score for that person. We present the use of all scores received by all persons and explore the a dvantages of such an approach when enough training data is available. More fundamentally, we i dentify four types of classifier combinations determined by the numbers of trained combining functions an d their input parameters. We prove that the improper choice of the combination type might result in only suboptimal performance of identification system. We investigate combinations, which consider all av ail ble matching scores and have only single trainable combination function. We introduce a part icular kind of such combinations utilizing identification models, which account for dependencies betw e n scores output by any one classifier. We present several experiments validating the advantage of our proposed combination algorithms for problems dealing with large number of classes, in particula r, biometric person identification systems."
