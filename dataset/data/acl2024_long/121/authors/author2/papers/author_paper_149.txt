    "abstract": "Mostfingerprint matching algorithms arebased onfinding correspondences betweenminutiae intwofinger- prints. Inthispaperwe present a modification ofminutiae matching method, whichutilizes correlation scores between thelocal neighborhood areasofcorresponding minutiae pairs andtheedgesthatconnect neighboring matchedminutiae pairs. Minutiae basedmatching approach considers theoverall minutiae distribution pattern betweenthetwofingerprints. Neighborhood correlation scorerepresents thelocal similar- itybetween thematchedpairofminutiae. Edgecorrelation scoregives theresemblance ofareasthatinbetween thetwo corresponding minutiae pairs. Thus,boththeglobal minutiae distribution structure andthelocal matching similarity between thetwofingerprints areconsidered forfinal decision. The described matching approach hasbeentested onFVC2002's DB1andDB3database. Theexperimental results confirm the effectiveness ofcombining matching scores ofdifferent origin - minutia matching score andlocal correlation matching scores. I.INTRODUCTION Because ofitspermanence andindividuality, fingerprint isoneofthemostusedbiometric currently usedforindi- vidual identification inapplications suchasaccess control. Fingerprint verification istheprocess ofcomparing test and enrolled skinridge impressions fromfingers todetermine iftheimpressions arefromthesamefinger. Theflexibility ofthefingerprint ridge skinmeansthat notwofingerprints areeverexactly alike, eveniftwoimpressions arerecorded immediately after eachother. Somefactors that makefinger- print matching verydifficult arethevarying darkness level caused bythechanging finger pressure andskincondition, thenon-linear distortion caused bytheelasticity oftheskin, therotation andpartial overlap caused bytheenrollment etc. Manyfingerprint matching algorithms havebeendeveloped forthepurpose ofidentification andrecognition during past years. We candistinguish three mainfingerprint matching tech- niques. Thefirst technique isaminutiae basedmatching. Minutiae aredefined asthediscontinuities oftheridges of thefingerprint. Givenafingerprint image, after appropriate imagepre-processing, enhancement, segmentation, minutiae points canbeextracted through different minutiae detection algorithm. Usually, minutiae arerepresented byatuple of values including itscoordinates, theridge direction and thetypeofendings. Through approaches ofpoint pattern matching, minutia based matching canbeimplemented. Var- iousminutiae based matching systems havebeendeveloped.
