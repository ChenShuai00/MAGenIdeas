    "title": "Playable Video Generation: Supplementary Material",
    "abstract": "In this Supplementary Material, we provide additional details regarding the neural network architecture used in our experiments (Sec. 1), our training procedure (Sec. 2) and the baseline selection process (Sec. 3). Then, we detail the results of our human evaluation in Sec. 4. Finally, we report more qualitative results in Sec. 6. Importantly, this document is completed by an accompanying website composed of two parts. The first (see play-bair.html, play.html and play-tennis.html) contains fully playable demos of CADDY running locally in the browser, the second (see main.html) shows qualitative results. Note that, to guarantee better compatibility across devices, our browser demo runs on CPU and may require up to ten seconds to load, while our complete model runs on GPU in real-time. Due to the limitations on the size of the submission files, it was possible to include only the model trained on the Atari Breakout dataset. Also, html format offers more possibilities in term of visualization (e.g. videos) and should be favored for qualitative evaluation."
