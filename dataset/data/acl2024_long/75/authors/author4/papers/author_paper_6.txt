    "title": "Semantic-Guided Image Augmentation with Pre-trained Models",
    "abstract": "Image augmentation is a common mechanism to alleviate data scarcity in computer vision. Existing image augmentation methods often apply pre-de\ufb01ned transformations or mixup to augment the original image, but only locally vary the image. This makes them struggle to \ufb01nd a balance between maintaining semantic information and improving the diversity of augmented images. In this paper, we propose a S emantic-guided I mage augmentation method with P re-trained models (SIP). Specifically, SIP constructs prompts with image labels and captions to better guide the image-to-image generation process of the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. The semantic information contained in the original images can be well preserved, and the augmented images still maintain diversity. Experimental results show that SIP can improve two commonly used backbones, i.e., ResNet-50 and ViT, by 12.60% and 2.07% on average over seven datasets, respectively. Moreover, SIP not only outperforms the best image augmentation baseline RandAug-ment by 4.46% and 1.23% on two backbones, but also further improves the performance by integrating naturally with the baseline. A detailed analysis of SIP is presented, including the diversity of augmented images, an ablation study on textual prompts, and a case study on the generated images."
