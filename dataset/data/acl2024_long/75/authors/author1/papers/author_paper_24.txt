    "abstract": "Annotation conversion is an effective way to 001 construct datasets under new annotation guide-002 lines based on existing datasets with little hu-003 man labour. Previous work has been limited 004 in conversion between tree-structured datasets 005 and mainly focused on feature-based models 006 which are not easily applicable to new conver-007 sion. In this paper, we propose two pretrained 008 model-based graph-to-graph annotation con-009 version approaches, namely Label Switching 010 and Graph2Graph Linear Transfer, which are 011 able to deal with conversion between graph-012 structured annotations and require no manu-013 ally designed feature. We manually construct a 014 graph-structured parallel annotated dataset and 015 evaluate the proposed approaches on it as well 016 as four existing parallel annotated datasets. 017 Experimental results show that the proposed 018 approaches outperform two strong baselines 019 across all the datasets. Furthermore, the com-020 bination of the two models have a better effect. 021"
