    "title": "Pro-HAN: A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network for Profile-based Spoken Language Understanding",
    "abstract": "Recently, Profile-based Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) has gained increasing attention, which aims to incorporate various types of supplementary profile information (i.e., Knowledge Graph, User Profile, Context Awareness) to eliminate the prevalent ambiguities in user utterances. However, existing approaches can only separately model different profile information, without considering their interrelationships or excluding irrelevant and conflicting information within them. To address the above issues, we introduce a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network to perform reasoning across multiple Profile information, called Pro-HAN. Specifically, we design three types of edges, denoted as intra-Pro, inter-Pro, and utterance-Pro, to capture interrelationships among multiple Pros. We establish a new state-of-the-art on the ProSLU dataset, with an improvement of approximately 8% across all three metrics. Further analysis experiments also confirm the effectiveness of our method in modeling multi-source profile information."
