    "title": "Towards Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Federated Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the feasibility of federated representation learning under the constraints of communication cost and privacy protection. Existing works either conduct annotation-guided local training which requires frequent communication or aggregates the client models via weight averaging which has potential risks of privacy exposure. To tackle the above problems, we first identify that self-supervised contrastive local training is robust against the non-identically distributed data, which provides the feasibility of longer local training and thus reduces the communication cost. Then based on the aforementioned robustness, we propose a novel Federated representation Learning framework with Ensemble Similarity Distillation~(FLESD) that utilizes this robustness. At each round of communication, the server first gathers a fraction of the clients' inferred similarity matrices on a public dataset. Then it ensembles the similarity matrices and train the global model via similarity distillation. We verify the effectiveness of FLESD by a series of empirical experiments and show that, despite stricter constraints, it achieves comparable results under multiple settings on multiple datasets."
