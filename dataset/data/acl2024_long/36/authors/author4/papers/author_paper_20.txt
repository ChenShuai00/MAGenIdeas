    "title": "A Bilinear Ranking SVM for Knowledge Based Relation Prediction and Classification",
    "abstract": "As an important and challenging problem, knowledge representation and inference are typically carried out in a knowledge embedding framework over a multi-relational knowledge graph, and thus have a wide range of applications such as semantic retrieval and question answering. In this paper, we propose a bilinear learning framework which performs cross-entity knowledge relation analysis in the continuous vector space (derived from knowledge embedding). In the framework, we effectively model the intrinsic correlations among different types of knowledge relations within a max-margin multi-relational ranking scheme, which jointly optimizes the tasks of entity embedding and cross-entity relation prediction in terms of multi-relational structures of the knowledge graph. Specifically, we devise a bilinear scoring function that aims to evaluate the confidence degree of semantic relation prediction for entity pairs through a multi-relational learning-to-rank pipeline. In essence, the pipeline formulates the problem of relation prediction for entity pairs as that of learning relation-specific ranking functions by max-margin optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on two common benchmark datasets."
