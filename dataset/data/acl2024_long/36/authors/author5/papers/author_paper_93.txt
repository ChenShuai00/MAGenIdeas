    "title": "Digital Library Engine: Adapting Digital Library for Cloud Computing",
    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of digital libraries, more data and smart services are involved. People come to recognize the importance of digital libraries and the convenience they might bring to the society. However, the cost of owning a digital library is quite high, and many institutions do not have the ability to run and maintain a digital library by themselves, especially for massive data and complex services which require lots of storage and computing resources. In this paper, we proposed the Digital Library Engine, which aims to provide a new Platform as a Service for fast developing and deploying digital libraries in cloud. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to create a PaaS system for digital libraries. With the help of Digital Library Engine, institutions only need to develop some service bundles, which can be deployed in the engine, and then their own digital libraries could be running well with features of scalability, reliability, security, extensibility, availability and manageability. The practice in CADAL and the experiments demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our engine."
