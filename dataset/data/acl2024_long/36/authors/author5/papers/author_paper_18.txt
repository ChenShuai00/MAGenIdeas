    "title": "Taxonomy Completion with Probabilistic Scorer via Box Embedding",
    "abstract": "Taxonomy completion, a task aimed at au-tomatically enriching an existing taxonomy with new concepts, has gained signi\ufb01cant in-terest in recent years. Previous works have introduced complex modules, external information, and pseudo-leaves to enrich the representation and unify the matching process of attachment and insertion. While they have achieved good performance, these introduc-tions may have brought noise and unfairness during training and scoring. In this paper, we present TaxBox, a novel framework for taxonomy completion that maps taxonomy concepts to box embeddings and employs two probabilistic scorers for concept attachment and insertion, avoiding the need for pseudo-leaves. Speci\ufb01cally, TaxBox consists of three components: (1) a graph aggregation module to leverage the structural information of the taxonomy and two lightweight decoders that map features to box embedding and capture complex relationships between concepts; (2) two probabilistic scorers that correspond to attachment and insertion operations and ensure the avoid-ance of pseudo-leaves; and (3) three learning objectives that assist the model in mapping concepts more granularly onto the box embedding space. Experimental results on four real-world datasets suggest that TaxBox outperforms baseline methods by a considerable margin and surpasses previous state-of-art methods to a certain extent."
