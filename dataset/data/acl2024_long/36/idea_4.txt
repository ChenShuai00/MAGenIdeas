    "Title": "Cross-Domain Self-Contrast: Enhancing LLM Generalization Through Multi-Domain Reflection",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the Self-Contrast method to a cross-domain setting, where the LLM applies the reflection process across multiple domains (e.g., mathematics, language, and coding) to improve its generalization capabilities. The LLM generates solving perspectives in one domain and contrasts them with perspectives from other domains, identifying common patterns and discrepancies that can inform its reasoning. This approach aims to enhance the LLM's ability to transfer knowledge and reasoning strategies across domains, leading to more robust and generalizable reasoning.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theory of **Scientific Paradigm Shift (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions)**. It represents a paradigm shift from domain-specific reflection to cross-domain reflection, which could lead to more generalizable reasoning. The idea also aligns with **Propose New Hypotheses (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method)**, as it introduces a novel hypothesis that cross-domain reflection can enhance LLM generalization. Additionally, the idea leverages **Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings (Kuhn’s theory of crises and revolutions)**, as cross-domain reflection helps identify and resolve inconsistencies that may not be apparent within a single domain.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLM reflection methods are often domain-specific, limiting their ability to generalize across different tasks and domains. By introducing cross-domain reflection, the LLM can transfer knowledge and reasoning strategies across domains, leading to more robust and generalizable reasoning. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance LLM performance on a wide range of tasks, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
