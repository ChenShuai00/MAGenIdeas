    "Title": "Dynamic Contextual Refinement: Adapting LLM Reasoning to Evolving Contexts",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic contextual refinement framework where LLMs continuously adapt their reasoning based on evolving contexts. The framework uses a feedback loop to monitor the LLM's reasoning process and adjust it in real-time based on new information or changing conditions. This approach ensures that the LLM's reasoning remains relevant and accurate, even in dynamic environments. The framework is particularly useful for tasks that require long-term reasoning or involve rapidly changing data.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which emphasizes the importance of adapting methods to new information. The dynamic feedback loop is informed by **Quine’s holism**, which ensures that the reasoning process is grounded in a broader context. The use of real-time adjustments aligns with **Duhem-Quine thesis**, which emphasizes the importance of critical experiments in refining theories.",
    "Rationale": "The dynamic contextual refinement framework addresses a critical limitation of current LLMs, which struggle to adapt their reasoning to evolving contexts. This approach is novel, scalable, and has the potential to significantly improve reasoning accuracy in dynamic environments, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards."
