    "Title": "Self-Verification Through Iterative Hypothesis Testing",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a self-verification mechanism where LLMs iteratively generate and test hypotheses to refine their reasoning. The process begins with the LLM generating an initial hypothesis, which is then tested against a set of constraints or external knowledge sources. If the hypothesis fails, the LLM generates alternative hypotheses and repeats the process until a satisfactory solution is found. This iterative approach ensures that the final output is both accurate and well-justified, addressing the overconfidence and randomness issues highlighted in the target paper.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, which emphasizes the generation and testing of hypotheses. The iterative refinement process is informed by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which focuses on improving existing methods through feedback loops. The use of external knowledge sources aligns with **Quine’s holism**, ensuring that the reasoning process is grounded in a broader context.",
    "Rationale": "The iterative hypothesis testing approach directly addresses the instability of LLM reflection by introducing a systematic verification process. This method is novel, scalable, and has the potential to significantly improve reasoning accuracy, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards."
