    "Title": "Self-Contrast with External Feedback: Combining Intrinsic and Extrinsic Reflection for Improved LLM Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the target paper's Self-Contrast method by incorporating external feedback into the reflection process. The framework uses a two-phase process where the LLM first generates multiple solutions using the Self-Contrast method, then refines these solutions based on feedback from external sources (e.g., human experts, knowledge bases). This approach ensures that the final output is both internally consistent and externally validated, addressing the limitations of purely intrinsic reflection.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which emphasizes the importance of external feedback in refining methods. The two-phase process aligns with **Duhem-Quine thesis**, which highlights the importance of critical experiments in refining theories. The use of external feedback is informed by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the importance of resolving anomalies through external validation.",
    "Rationale": "The combination of intrinsic and extrinsic reflection addresses a critical limitation of current LLMs, which struggle to balance internal consistency with external validation. This approach is novel, scalable, and has the potential to significantly improve reasoning accuracy, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards."
