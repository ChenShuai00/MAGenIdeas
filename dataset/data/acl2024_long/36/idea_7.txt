    "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Reflection: Enhancing LLM Self-Evaluation Through Probabilistic Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an uncertainty-aware reflection mechanism where LLMs generate probabilistic feedback on their own outputs. Instead of providing a single, deterministic evaluation, the model assigns a probability distribution to different aspects of its response (e.g., correctness, relevance, coherence). This probabilistic feedback is then used to guide the model's reflection process, allowing it to focus on areas of high uncertainty and refine its outputs accordingly. The approach also includes a 'confidence calibration' module that adjusts the model's self-evaluation based on its historical performance, ensuring that the feedback is both accurate and reliable.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of 'Propose New Hypotheses' and 'Evaluating and Selecting Competing Theories.' The uncertainty-aware reflection mechanism introduces a new hypothesis that probabilistic feedback can lead to more accurate and stable self-evaluation in LLMs. The confidence calibration module aligns with the need to evaluate competing theories (e.g., different levels of confidence in the model's output) and select the most reliable feedback. This approach also leverages 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings' by addressing the high randomness in LLM self-evaluation through probabilistic modeling.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLM self-evaluation methods often fail to account for uncertainty, leading to overconfident or inconsistent feedback. By introducing probabilistic feedback, the model can better assess the reliability of its own outputs and focus on areas where it is less certain. This approach not only improves the accuracy of self-evaluation but also provides a more nuanced understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses. The confidence calibration module ensures that the feedback is calibrated based on the model's historical performance, addressing the key bottleneck of unstable self-evaluated feedback identified in the target paper."
