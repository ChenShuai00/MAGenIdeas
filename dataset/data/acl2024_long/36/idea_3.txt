    "Title": "Meta-Reflection: A Hierarchical Framework for LLM Self-Improvement",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a meta-reflection framework where the LLM engages in a higher-level reflection process that evaluates and refines its own reflection strategies. The framework consists of two levels: the base level, where the LLM performs task-specific reasoning and reflection (e.g., using Self-Contrast), and the meta level, where the LLM evaluates the effectiveness of its reflection strategies and iteratively improves them. The meta-level reflection is guided by a set of meta-rules that encourage the LLM to explore alternative reflection strategies and select the most effective ones based on past performance. This approach aims to create a self-improving LLM that continuously enhances its reasoning and reflection capabilities.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theory of **Scientific Paradigm Shift (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions)**. It represents a paradigm shift from static reflection strategies to a dynamic, self-improving framework. The idea also aligns with **Propose New Hypotheses (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method)**, as it introduces a novel hypothesis that meta-reflection can lead to continuous self-improvement in LLMs. Additionally, the idea leverages **Evaluating and Selecting Competing Theories (Sober’s theory selection criteria)**, as the meta-level reflection process involves evaluating and selecting the most effective reflection strategies.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLM reflection methods are static and do not adapt over time. By introducing a meta-reflection framework, the LLM can continuously improve its reflection strategies, leading to better performance on complex reasoning tasks. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance LLM capabilities, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
