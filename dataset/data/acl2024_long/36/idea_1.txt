    "Title": "Self-Contrast++: Integrating External Knowledge for Enhanced LLM Reflection",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the Self-Contrast method by integrating external knowledge sources (e.g., knowledge graphs, databases, or expert systems) into the reflection process. The LLM generates multiple solving perspectives as in Self-Contrast, but instead of relying solely on internal reasoning, it queries external knowledge sources to validate or refute its hypotheses. The discrepancies identified during the contrast phase are then cross-referenced with external knowledge to ensure accuracy. This approach aims to reduce overconfidence and randomness in self-evaluation by grounding the reflection process in external, verifiable information.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theory of **Design and Improve Existing Methods (Laudan’s methodological improvement model)**. It builds upon the Self-Contrast method by integrating external knowledge, which represents a methodological improvement. The idea also aligns with **Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings (Kuhn’s theory of crises and revolutions)**, as external knowledge can help explain and resolve anomalies in the LLM's reasoning. Additionally, the idea leverages **Evaluating and Selecting Competing Theories (Sober’s theory selection criteria)**, as the integration of external knowledge provides a basis for evaluating the validity of competing reasoning paths.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that LLMs often struggle with factual accuracy and consistency, especially in complex reasoning tasks. By integrating external knowledge, the LLM can ground its reasoning in verifiable information, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving the reliability of its outputs. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance LLM performance on tasks requiring high levels of accuracy, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
