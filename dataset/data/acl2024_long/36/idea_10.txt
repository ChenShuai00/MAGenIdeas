    "Title": "Multi-Agent Reflective Debate: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Through Collaborative Reflection",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-agent framework where multiple LLMs engage in a reflective debate to solve complex reasoning tasks. Each agent generates a solution from a unique perspective, followed by a collaborative reflection phase where discrepancies are identified and resolved. The framework leverages the strengths of diverse reasoning paths while mitigating individual biases. The final solution is derived through a consensus mechanism that integrates the most consistent and accurate elements from each agent's reasoning. This approach not only improves reasoning accuracy but also provides a transparent and interpretable process for decision-making.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (identifying anomalies in single-agent reasoning) and **Quine’s holism** (constructing a unified theoretical model from diverse perspectives). The multi-agent debate aligns with the target paper's focus on contrasting perspectives but extends it to a collaborative setting. The reflective phase is informed by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which emphasizes iterative refinement. The consensus mechanism is designed using **Duhem-Quine thesis**, ensuring that the final solution is robust and verifiable.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs struggle with consistency and bias in reasoning. By introducing a multi-agent debate, this idea addresses these limitations by leveraging diverse perspectives and collaborative reflection. The framework is novel, scalable, and has the potential to significantly improve reasoning accuracy, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards."
