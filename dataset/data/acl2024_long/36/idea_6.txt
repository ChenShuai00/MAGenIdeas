    "Title": "Dynamic Feedback Loops: Iterative Self-Improvement in LLMs Through Real-Time Error Correction",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a dynamic feedback loop mechanism where LLMs continuously refine their outputs through iterative self-improvement. The model generates an initial response, evaluates its own output using a set of predefined criteria (e.g., logical consistency, factual accuracy), and then iteratively corrects errors in real-time. The feedback loop is guided by a 'self-correcting' module that identifies discrepancies between the model's output and the desired criteria, prompting the model to revise its response until it meets a predefined threshold of accuracy. This approach aims to enhance the stability and reliability of LLM self-evaluation by enabling continuous, real-time error correction.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in the theories of 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' and 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings.' The dynamic feedback loop represents a methodological improvement over existing reflection methods by introducing real-time error correction. The self-correcting module addresses anomalous findings (e.g., inconsistencies in the model's output) by iteratively refining the response, which aligns with the need to revisit basic assumptions and develop auxiliary hypotheses to improve LLM self-evaluation.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLM reflection methods often produce unstable feedback due to overconfidence or high randomness in self-evaluation. By implementing a dynamic feedback loop, the model can continuously monitor and correct its own outputs, leading to more accurate and reliable results. This approach also reduces the need for external feedback, making it more scalable and applicable to a wide range of tasks. The iterative nature of the feedback loop ensures that the model's outputs are consistently refined, addressing the key limitations identified in the target paper."
