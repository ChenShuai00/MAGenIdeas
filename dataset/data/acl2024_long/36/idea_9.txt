    "Title": "Adaptive Reflection: Tailoring LLM Self-Evaluation to Task-Specific Requirements",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an adaptive reflection mechanism where LLMs tailor their self-evaluation process to the specific requirements of the task at hand. The model dynamically adjusts its reflection criteria based on the task's complexity, domain, and desired outcomes. For example, in a logical reasoning task, the model might prioritize consistency and coherence, while in a factual accuracy task, it might focus on verifying specific claims. The adaptive reflection mechanism is guided by a 'task-awareness' module that identifies the key requirements of the task and adjusts the model's self-evaluation process accordingly. This approach aims to enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of LLM self-evaluation by ensuring that the reflection process is aligned with the task's specific needs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' and 'Evaluating and Selecting Competing Theories.' The adaptive reflection mechanism represents a methodological improvement over existing reflection methods by introducing task-specific criteria for self-evaluation. The task-awareness module aligns with the need to evaluate competing theories (e.g., different reflection criteria for different tasks) and select the most appropriate feedback. This approach also leverages 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings' by addressing the inconsistencies in LLM self-evaluation through task-specific adjustments.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLM self-evaluation methods often apply a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not be effective for all tasks. By tailoring the reflection process to the specific requirements of the task, the model can provide more accurate and relevant feedback. This approach not only improves the effectiveness of self-evaluation but also enhances the model's ability to handle a wide range of tasks. The adaptive reflection mechanism addresses the key limitations identified in the target paper by ensuring that the reflection process is aligned with the task's specific needs, leading to more stable and reliable feedback."
