    "Title": "Cross-Domain Reflective Reasoning: Leveraging Multi-Domain Knowledge for Enhanced LLM Performance",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a cross-domain reflective reasoning framework where LLMs leverage knowledge from multiple domains to improve their reasoning. The framework uses a multi-step process where the LLM first identifies relevant knowledge from different domains, then integrates this knowledge into a unified reasoning process. The final output is refined through a reflective phase where discrepancies between domains are identified and resolved. This approach ensures that the LLM's reasoning is both comprehensive and accurate, even in complex, multi-domain tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Quine’s holism**, which emphasizes the importance of integrating diverse knowledge sources into a unified theoretical model. The reflective phase is informed by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which highlights the importance of identifying and resolving anomalies. The use of multi-domain knowledge aligns with **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, which emphasizes the generation of hypotheses from diverse perspectives.",
    "Rationale": "The cross-domain reflective reasoning framework addresses a critical limitation of current LLMs, which struggle to integrate knowledge from multiple domains. This approach is novel, scalable, and has the potential to significantly improve reasoning accuracy in complex tasks, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards."
