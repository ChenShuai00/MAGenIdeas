    "Title": "Cross-Model Reflection: Leveraging External Models for Enhanced LLM Self-Evaluation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a cross-model reflection framework where LLMs leverage external models (e.g., specialized fact-checking models, reasoning engines) to enhance their self-evaluation capabilities. The LLM generates an initial response and then queries external models to verify specific aspects of its output (e.g., factual accuracy, logical consistency). The feedback from these external models is integrated into the LLM's reflection process, allowing it to refine its response based on more reliable and diverse sources of information. This approach aims to improve the stability and accuracy of LLM self-evaluation by incorporating external expertise into the reflection process.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in the theories of 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' and 'Scientific Paradigm Shift.' The cross-model reflection framework represents a methodological improvement over existing reflection methods by integrating external models into the self-evaluation process. The paradigm shift lies in moving from a self-contained reflection model to a cross-model collaborative model, which fundamentally changes how LLMs handle self-evaluation. This approach also aligns with 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings' by addressing inconsistencies in the LLM's output through external verification.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLM self-evaluation methods are limited by the model's internal biases and knowledge gaps. By leveraging external models, the LLM can access more reliable and diverse sources of information, leading to more accurate and stable feedback. This approach also reduces the risk of overconfidence or high randomness in self-evaluation, as the external models provide an additional layer of verification. The cross-model reflection framework addresses the key limitations identified in the target paper by enhancing the LLM's ability to identify and correct errors in its own outputs."
