    "Title": "Multi-Agent Debate for Enhancing LLM Self-Reflection and Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-agent debate framework where multiple LLM agents engage in a structured debate to refine their reasoning and self-reflection capabilities. Each agent takes on a distinct role (e.g., advocate, critic, mediator) and iteratively critiques and refines the reasoning paths generated by other agents. The debate process is guided by a set of rules that encourage divergent thinking and exploration of alternative perspectives. The final output is a consensus-based reasoning path that has been rigorously vetted through the debate process. This approach aims to address the instability of intrinsic reflection in LLMs by leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple agents, reducing biases, and improving the robustness of reasoning.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theory of **Propose New Hypotheses (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method)** and **Scientific Paradigm Shift (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions)**. The multi-agent debate framework introduces a novel hypothesis that collective reasoning through debate can enhance LLM self-reflection. It also represents a paradigm shift from single-agent reflection to multi-agent collaboration, which could lead to more robust and reliable reasoning. The idea also aligns with **Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings (Kuhn’s theory of crises and revolutions)**, as the debate process helps identify and resolve inconsistencies in reasoning paths.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLM self-reflection methods, such as Self-Contrast, rely on a single agent's perspective, which can be limited by biases and inconsistencies. By introducing a multi-agent debate framework, the LLM can explore a wider range of perspectives, leading to more accurate and stable reasoning. This approach has the potential to significantly improve LLM performance on complex reasoning tasks, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences."
