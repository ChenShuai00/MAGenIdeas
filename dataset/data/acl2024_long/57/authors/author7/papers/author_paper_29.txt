    "title": "EgoPlan-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Human-Level Planning",
    "abstract": "The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been accelerated by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which exhibit superior reasoning, generalization capabilities, and proficiency in processing multimodal inputs. A crucial milestone in the evolution of AGI is the attainment of human-level planning, a fundamental ability for making informed decisions in complex environments, and solving a wide range of real-world problems. Despite the impressive advancements in MLLMs, a question remains: How far are current MLLMs from achieving human-level planning? To shed light on this question, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the planning abilities of MLLMs in real-world scenarios from an egocentric perspective, mirroring human perception. EgoPlan-Bench emphasizes the evaluation of planning capabilities of MLLMs, featuring realistic tasks, diverse action plans, and intricate visual observations. Our rigorous evaluation of a wide range of MLLMs reveals that EgoPlan-Bench poses significant challenges, highlighting a substantial scope for improvement in MLLMs to achieve human-level task planning. To facilitate this advancement, we further present EgoPlan-IT, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset that effectively enhances model performance on EgoPlan-Bench. We have made all codes, data, and a maintained benchmark leaderboard available to advance future research."
