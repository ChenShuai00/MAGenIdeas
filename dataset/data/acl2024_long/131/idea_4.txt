    "Title": "Dynamic Curriculum Learning for Transformers: Improving Generalization on Sensitive Functions",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic curriculum learning framework for transformers that incrementally increases the complexity of tasks during training, focusing on improving generalization for sensitive functions such as PARITY. The framework will use a degree-based curriculum, where tasks are ordered by their sensitivity or complexity, and the model is trained on progressively harder tasks. The goal is to guide the model towards learning high-sensitivity functions by gradually exposing it to more challenging tasks, thereby overcoming the low-sensitivity bias. The effectiveness of the framework will be evaluated through experiments on tasks such as PARITY and other formal languages, demonstrating improved generalization and robustness.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**. The former suggests improving existing methods by integrating new tools and techniques, while the latter encourages proposing new hypotheses based on analogical reasoning. The referenced paper 'Generalization on the Unseen, Logic Reasoning and Degree Curriculum' provides a foundation for this idea, and the target paper highlights the difficulty of learning sensitive functions in transformers. By proposing a dynamic curriculum learning framework, this idea addresses a fundamental limitation of transformers and offers a practical solution with broad applicability.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is rooted in the empirical success of curriculum learning in improving generalization, as demonstrated in the referenced paper. The target paper identifies sensitivity as a key challenge for transformers, and this idea directly addresses that challenge by proposing a novel curriculum learning framework. If successful, this approach could significantly improve transformer performance on tasks requiring high sensitivity, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
