    "Title": "Transformers with Adaptive Sensitivity: A New Architecture for Learning Sensitive Functions",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a new transformer architecture that dynamically adapts its sensitivity to different parts of the input. The key innovation is the introduction of an adaptive sensitivity mechanism that modulates the attention weights based on the input's sensitivity profile. This allows the transformer to focus more on sensitive parts of the input when necessary, improving its ability to learn tasks like PARITY. The adaptive sensitivity mechanism is inspired by the theoretical insights from the target paper, which highlight the importance of input-space sensitivity in transformer learning.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the scientific discovery theory of 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). The target paper identifies that transformers' sensitivity to input-space constraints limits their ability to learn certain functions. By designing a new architecture that adapts to these constraints, we can directly address this limitation. This approach also aligns with 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions), as it proposes a new conceptual framework for understanding and improving transformer architectures.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the theoretical insights from the target paper, which highlight the importance of input-space sensitivity in transformer learning. By introducing an adaptive sensitivity mechanism, we can improve transformers' ability to learn sensitive functions, which would have significant implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards because it addresses a fundamental limitation of transformers, proposes a novel architecture, and has the potential to lead to significant advancements in the field."
