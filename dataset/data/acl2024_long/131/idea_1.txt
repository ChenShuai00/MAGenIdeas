    "Title": "Spectral Bias in Transformers: A Unified Framework for Understanding Generalization",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a unified framework for understanding the spectral bias of transformers, building on the observation that transformers tend to prioritize low-frequency functions. The framework will analyze the relationship between spectral bias, sensitivity, and generalization in transformers, using tools from Fourier analysis and Boolean function theory. The goal is to develop a theoretical model that explains why transformers struggle with high-sensitivity functions and to propose interventions that can mitigate this bias. The framework will be validated through experiments on tasks such as PARITY and other formal languages, demonstrating how spectral bias influences transformer performance and how it can be controlled to improve generalization.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** and **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**. The former suggests abstracting general laws from multiple related studies, while the latter encourages exploring theoretical boundaries and identifying anomalies. The target paper highlights the low-sensitivity bias in transformers, and the referenced paper 'Spectral Bias in Practice: The Role of Function Frequency in Generalization' provides a foundation for understanding spectral bias in neural networks. By synthesizing these insights, this idea proposes a unified framework that connects spectral bias, sensitivity, and generalization in transformers, offering a novel perspective on their limitations and potential improvements.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the growing body of evidence that spectral bias plays a key role in the generalization properties of neural networks. The target paper identifies sensitivity as a critical factor in transformer performance, and this idea bridges the gap between spectral bias and sensitivity, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving transformer generalization. By developing a unified framework, this idea has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of transformers and their limitations, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
