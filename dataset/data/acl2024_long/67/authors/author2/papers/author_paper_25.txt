    "title": "Cross-Lingual G EN QA: Open-Domain Question Answering with Answer Sentence Generation",
    "abstract": "Recent approaches for question answering systems have achieved impressive performance on English by combining document-level retrieval with answer generation. These approaches, which we refer to as G EN QA, are able to generate full sentences, effectively answering both factoid and non-factoid questions. In this paper, we extend G EN QA beyond English and present the \ufb01rst Cross-Lingual answer sentence generation system (C ROSS -L INGUAL G EN QA). Our system produces natural, full-sentence answers to questions in several languages by exploiting passages written in multiple other languages. To foster further development on this topic, we introduce G EN -T Y D I QA, an extension of the TyDiQA dataset with well-formed and complete answers for Arabic, Bengali, English, Japanese, and Russian questions. Using G EN -T Y D I QA, we show that multi-language models outperform monolingual G EN QA in the four non-English languages; for three of them, our C ROSS -L INGUAL G EN QA system achieves the best results."
