    "title": "Towards Citation-Based Summarization of Biomedical Literature",
    "abstract": "Citation-based summarization is a form of technical summarization that uses citations to an article to form its summary. In biomedical literature, citations by themselves are not reliable to be used for summary as they fail to consider the context of the findings in the referenced article. One way to remedy such problem is to link citations to the related text spans in the reference article. The ultimate goal in TAC1 biomedical summarization track is to generate a citation-based summary, using both the citations and the context information. This paper describes our approach for finding the context information related to each citation and determining their discourse facet (Task 1 of the track). We approach this task as a search task, applying different query reformulation techniques for retrieving the relevant text spans. After finding the relevant spans, we classify each citation to a set of discourse facets to capture the structure of the referenced paper. While our results show 20% improvement over the baseline, the efficiency of the system still leaves much room for improvement."
