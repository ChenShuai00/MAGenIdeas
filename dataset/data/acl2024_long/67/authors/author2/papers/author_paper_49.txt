    "abstract": "Recent surveys have shown that a growing number internet users seek medical help online. Yet, recent research [12] has shown that many commercial search engine still struggle in completely satisfying the information need of users. In this work, we present a study on the use of medical terms for query reformulation. We use synonyms and hypernyms from a large medical ontology to generate alternative formulations for a query; Results obtained by the reformulated queries are fused using the Borda rank aggregation algorithm."
