    "abstract": "Many complicated techniques have been introduced to aid in computer processing of natural languages. While this is generally considered to be a difficult task, many approaches have ignored the prevalent class of monolexical languages, or languages that consist of a single word. Here we present some desirable properties of such languages and apply techniques for common NLP tasks."
