    "abstract": "Social media is one of the most highly sought 001 resources to analyze characteristics of the lan-002 guage by its users. In particular, many re-003 searchers utilized various linguistic features 004 to identify users with mental disorders. How-005 ever, generalizing linguistic features of such 006 psychiatric patients is challenging since these 007 features are apparently dependent on cultural or 008 personal language habits. To address this chal-009 lenge, we make use of the symptoms, which 010 are shared properties of people with mental ill-011 ness, concerning clinical contents rather than 012 the ways of expressing them. In this paper, we 013 aim to let our classification model identify in-014 formative features by training on knowledge 015 about the symptoms. To this end, we propose 016 a multi-head siamese network, which captures 017 informative features based on the knowledge of 018 mental illness symptoms and compares them to 019 those of target text to be classified. The model 020 is designed to learn the required knowledge 021 by reading just a few questions from self-tests, 022 and to identify similar stories from social me-023 dia texts. Experimental results demonstrate that 024 our model achieves improved performance as 025 well as human-interpretable results for mental 026 illness symptoms. A case study shows that our 027 proposed model offers the possibility of auto-028 matic mental illness diagnosis, grounded on 029 rational reasons. 030"
