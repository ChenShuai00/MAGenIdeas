    "title": "Design and Fabrication of a Novel High Power THz Slow Wave Structure Based on MEMS Technology",
    "abstract": "With the development of TWT in terahertz band, the size of TWT is greatly reduced and the power gain is also reduced. In order to improve the performance of traveling wave tube (TWT), an E-plane and H-plane tapered folded waveguide slow wave structure operating at 0.34THz is designed. In order to reduce the RF loss, a gradual ridge is added to the E-plane ridge. Compared with other ridge loaded structures, the coupling impedance of this structure has been significantly improved, and it has better dispersion characteristics and higher maximum output power. According to the electromagnetic simulation results, under the condition of 16.8kV, 50mA banded electron beam, the maximum output power of the folded waveguide can reach 65.1w, the power gain can reach 31.8db, the 3dB working bandwidth can reach 12GHz, and the electronic efficiency can reach 7.75%. Finally, a complete DRIE process for processing slow wave structure is explored. The slow wave structure is fabricated by combining silicon with non-silicon."
