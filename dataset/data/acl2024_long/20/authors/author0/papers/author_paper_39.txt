    "title": "Contrastive Learning for Robust Android Malware Familial Classification",
    "abstract": "Due to its open-source nature, Android operating system has been the main target of attackers to exploit. Malware creators always perform different code obfuscations on their apps to hide malicious activities. Features extracted from these obfuscated samples through program analysis contain many useless and disguised features, which leads to many false negatives. To address the issue, in this paper, we demonstrate that obfuscation-resilient malware family analysis can be achieved through contrastive learning. The key insight behind our analysis is that contrastive learning can be used to reduce the difference introduced by obfuscation while amplifying the difference between malware and other types of malware. Based on the proposed analysis, we design a system that can achieve robust and interpretable classification of Android malware. To achieve robust classification, we perform contrastive learning on malware samples to learn an encoder that can automatically extract robust features from malware samples. To achieve interpretable classification, we transform the function call graph of a sample into an image by centrality analysis. Then the corresponding heatmaps can be obtained by visualization techniques. These heatmaps can help users understand why the malware is classified as this family. We implement \\emph{IFDroid} and perform extensive evaluations on two datasets. Experimental results show that \\emph{IFDroid} is superior to state-of-the-art Android malware familial classification systems. Moreover, \\emph{IFDroid} is capable of maintaining a 98.4\\% F1 on classifying 69,421 obfuscated malware samples."
