    "title": "Learning \"O\" Helps for Learning More: Handling the Concealed Entity Problem for Class-incremental NER",
    "abstract": "As the categories of named entities rapidly increase in real-world applications, class-incremental learning for NER is in demand, which continually learns new entity classes while maintaining the old knowledge. Due to privacy concerns and storage constraints, the model is required to update without any annotations of the old entity classes. However, in each step on streaming data, the \"O\" class in each step might contain unlabeled entities from the old classes, or potential entities from the incoming classes. In this work, we \ufb01rst carry out an empirical study to investigate the concealed entity problem in class-incremental NER. We \ufb01nd that training with \"O\" leads to severe confusion of \"O\" and concealed entity classes, and harms the separability of potential classes. Based on this discovery, we design a rehearsal-based representation learning approach for appropriately learning the \"O\" class for both old and potential entity classes. Additionally, we provide a more realistic and challenging benchmark for class-incremental NER which introduces multiple categories in each step. Experimental results verify our \ufb01ndings and show the effectiveness of the proposed method on the new benchmark."
