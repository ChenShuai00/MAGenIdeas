    "title": "Plug-Tagger: A Pluggable Sequence Labeling Framework Using Language Models",
    "abstract": "Plug-and-play functionality allows deep learning models to adapt well to different tasks without requiring any parameters modified. Recently, prefix-tuning was shown to be a plug-and-play method on various text generation tasks by simply inserting corresponding continuous vectors into the inputs. However, sequence labeling tasks invalidate existing plug-and-play methods since different label sets demand changes to the architecture of the model classifier. In this work, we propose the use of label word prediction instead of classification to totally reuse the architecture of pre-trained models for sequence labeling tasks. Specifically, for each task, a label word set is first constructed by selecting a high-frequency word for each class respectively, and then, task-specific vectors are inserted into the inputs and optimized to manipulate the model predictions towards the corresponding label words. As a result, by simply switching the plugin vectors on the input, a frozen pre-trained language model is allowed to perform different tasks. Experimental results on three sequence labeling tasks show that the performance of the proposed method can achieve comparable performance with standard fine-tuning with only 0.1\\% task-specific parameters. In addition, our method is up to 70 times faster than non-plug-and-play methods while switching different tasks under the resource-constrained scenario."
