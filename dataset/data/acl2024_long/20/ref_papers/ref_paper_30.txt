    "title": "ReCoRD: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Commonsense Reading Comprehension",
    "abstract": "We present a large-scale dataset, ReCoRD, for machine reading comprehension requiring commonsense reasoning. Experiments on this dataset demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art MRC systems fall far behind human performance. ReCoRD represents a challenge for future research to bridge the gap between human and machine commonsense reading comprehension. ReCoRD is available at this http URL"
