    "title": "Examining the Inter-Consistency of Large Language Models: An In-depth Analysis via Debate",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like intelligence and are widely used in various applications. However, LLMs still exhibit various kinds of inconsistency problems. Existing works mainly focus on the inconsistency issues within a single LLM, while we investigate the inter-consistency among multiple LLMs, which is critical for collaborating to solve a complex task. To examine whether LLMs can collaborate to ultimately achieve a consensus for the shared goal and whether LLMs easily change their viewpoints, we introduce a Formal Debate framework (FORD) With FORD, we conduct a three-stage debate aligned with real-world scenarios: fair debate, mismatched debate, and roundtable debate. Through extensive experiments on the commonsense reasoning task, LLMs not only become more inter-consistent but also achieve higher performance. More-over, we observe that stronger LLMs tend to dominate the debates by adhering to their perspectives, while weaker ones are more likely to change viewpoints. Additionally, we highlight the importance of a competent judge, such as GPT-4, to draw more proper conclusions. Our work contributes to understanding the inter-consistency among LLMs and lays the foundation for the development of future collaboration methods."
