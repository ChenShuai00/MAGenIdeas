    "Title": "Dynamic Multi-Agent Collaboration for Code Generation with Self-Refinement",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic multi-agent collaboration framework where multiple LLM agents, each specialized in a specific aspect of code generation (e.g., syntax, logic, optimization), work together to generate and refine code. The framework incorporates self-refinement mechanisms inspired by human debugging processes, where agents iteratively provide feedback and corrections to each other. The system leverages a graph-based consistency model to ensure inter-agent coherence and integrates execution-based verification to validate the correctness of generated code. This approach aims to address the limitations of single-agent LLMs in handling complex programming tasks by simulating collaborative human-like problem-solving.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Propose New Hypotheses** (Peirce’s hypothetical deduction method) and **Design and Improve Existing Methods** (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). The hypothesis is that multi-agent collaboration can mimic human teamwork, leading to more robust and accurate code generation. The improvement lies in integrating self-refinement and execution-based verification, which are not fully explored in the target paper. The graph-based consistency model extends the MPSC framework by adding dynamic collaboration layers.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs struggle with complex programming tasks due to their single-agent nature, which lacks the collaborative problem-solving capabilities of human teams. By introducing multi-agent collaboration and self-refinement, this framework can significantly improve code quality and correctness, especially for complex tasks. The integration of execution-based verification ensures that the generated code is not only consistent but also functionally correct, addressing a key limitation of existing methods.",
