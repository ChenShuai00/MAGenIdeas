    "title": "Learning Temporal Video Procedure Segmentation from an Automatically Collected Large Dataset",
    "abstract": "Temporal Video Segmentation (TVS) is a fundamental video understanding task and has been widely researched in recent years. There are two subtasks of TVS: Video Action Segmentation (VAS) and Video Procedure Segmentation (VPS): VAS aims to recognize what actions happen in-side the video while VPS aims to segment the video into a sequence of video clips as a procedure. The VAS task inevitably relies on pre-defined action labels and is thus hard to scale to various open-domain videos. To overcome this limitation, the VPS task tries to divide a video into several category-independent procedure segments. However, the existing dataset for the VPS task is small (2k videos) and lacks diversity (only cooking domain). To tackle these problems, we collect a large and diverse dataset called TIPS, specifically for the VPS task. TIPS contains 63k videos including more than 300k procedure segments from instructional videos on YouTube, which covers plenty of how-to areas such as cooking, health, beauty, parenting, gardening, etc. We then propose a multi-modal Transformer with Gaussian Boundary Detection (MT-GBD) model for VPS, with the backbone of the Transformer and Convolution. Furthermore, we propose a new EIOU metric for the VPS task, which helps better evaluate VPS quality in a more comprehensive way. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model and metric."
