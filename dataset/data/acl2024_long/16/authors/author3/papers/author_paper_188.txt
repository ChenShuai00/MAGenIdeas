    "title": "Minimum Bayes Risk based Answer Re-ranking for Question Answering",
    "abstract": "This paper presents two minimum Bayes risk (MBR) based Answer Re-ranking (MBRAR) approaches for the question answering (QA) task. The first approach re-ranks single QA system\u2019s outputs by using a traditional MBR model, by measuring correlations between answer candidates; while the second approach reranks the combined outputs of multiple QA systems with heterogenous answer extraction components by using a mixture model-based MBR model. Evaluations are performed on factoid questions selected from two different domains: Jeopardy! and Web, and significant improvements are achieved on all data sets."
