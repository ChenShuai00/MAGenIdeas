    "title": "Hybrid Reasoning Network for Video-based Commonsense Captioning",
    "abstract": "The task of video-based commonsense captioning aims to generate event-wise captions and meanwhile provide multiple commonsense descriptions (e.g., attribute, effect and intention) about the underlying event in the video. Prior works explore the commonsense captions by using separate networks for different commonsense types, which is time-consuming and lacks mining the interaction of different commonsense. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Reasoning Network (HybridNet) to endow the neural networks with the capability of semantic-level reasoning and word-level reasoning. Firstly, we develop multi-commonsense learning for semantic-level reasoning by jointly training different commonsense types in a unified network, which encourages the interaction between the clues of multiple commonsense descriptions, event-wise captions and videos. Then, there are two steps to achieve the word-level reasoning: (1) a memory module records the history predicted sequence from the previous generation processes; (2) a memory-routed multi-head attention (MMHA) module updates the word-level attention maps by incorporating the history information from the memory module into the transformer decoder for word-level reasoning. Moreover, the multimodal features are used to make full use of diverse knowledge for commonsense reasoning. Experiments and abundant analysis on the large-scale Video-to-Commonsense benchmark show that our HybridNet achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other methods."
