    "title": "Learning Semantic Concepts and Temporal Alignment for Narrated Video Procedural Captioning",
    "abstract": "Video captioning is a fundamental task for visual understanding. Previous works employ end-to-end networks to learn from the low-level vision feature and generate descriptive captions, which are hard to recognize fine-grained objects and lacks the understanding of crucial semantic concepts. According to DPC [19], these concepts generally present in the narrative transcripts of the instructional videos. The incorporation of transcript and video can improve the captioning performance. However, DPC directly concatenates the embedding of transcript with video features, which is incapable of fusing language and vision features effectively and leads to the temporal mis-alignment between transcript and video. This motivates us to 1) learn the semantic concepts explicitly and 2) design a temporal alignment mechanism to better align the video and transcript for the captioning task. In this paper, we start with an encoder-decoder backbone using transformer models. Firstly, we design a semantic concept prediction module as a multi-task to train the encoder in a supervised way. Then, we develop an attention based cross-modality temporal alignment method that combines the sequential video frames and transcript sentences. Finally, we adopt a copy mechanism to enable the decoder(generation) module to copy important concepts from source transcript directly. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which achieves state-of-the-art results on YouCookII dataset."
