    "Title": "Cross-Domain Multi-Perspective Consistency for Code Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the application of the MPSC framework across different programming domains (e.g., web development, data science, systems programming). By training the framework on diverse datasets from various domains, we can create a more generalizable model that performs well across different coding tasks. The framework would include domain-specific adapters that fine-tune the perspectives based on the target domain, ensuring high accuracy and relevance.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory and Kitcher’s unified theory of science. By synthesizing knowledge from multiple domains, we can create a more comprehensive and versatile code generation model. The domain-specific adapters ensure that the framework remains relevant and effective across different programming contexts.",
    "Rationale": "Current code generation models often struggle with domain-specific tasks due to a lack of specialized training. By extending the MPSC framework to multiple domains, we can create a model that excels in a wide range of programming tasks, making it more useful for real-world applications.",
