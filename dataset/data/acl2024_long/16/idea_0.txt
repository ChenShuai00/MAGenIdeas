    "Title": "Dynamic Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency with Reinforcement Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the MPSC framework by incorporating reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically adjust the weights of different perspectives (Solution, Specification, and Test case) based on their historical performance. The RL agent learns to prioritize perspectives that consistently lead to correct solutions, improving the overall accuracy and efficiency of code generation. The framework would include a feedback loop where the RL agent updates its strategy based on the success rate of generated solutions, ensuring continuous improvement.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Laudan’s methodological improvement model and Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving. By integrating RL, we can iteratively improve the MPSC framework, making it more adaptive and effective. The RL agent’s ability to learn from past experiences aligns with the problem-solving approach, ensuring that the framework evolves to handle complex coding tasks better.",
    "Rationale": "Current MPSC frameworks treat all perspectives equally, which may not always be optimal. By dynamically adjusting perspective weights based on performance, we can enhance the framework’s ability to generate correct solutions. This approach leverages the strengths of each perspective while mitigating their weaknesses, leading to more robust code generation.",
