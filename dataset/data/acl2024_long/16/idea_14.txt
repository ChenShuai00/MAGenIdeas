    "Title": "Interactive Code Generation with Human-in-the-Loop Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an interactive code generation framework where LLMs collaborate with human developers in real-time. The system generates initial code suggestions, which are then refined through iterative feedback from the human developer. The feedback is incorporated into the model using reinforcement learning, enabling the system to learn from human expertise and improve over time. The approach is evaluated on real-world programming tasks, with a focus on improving the usability and effectiveness of LLM-based code generation tools.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Propose New Hypotheses** (Peirce’s hypothetical deduction method) and **Design and Improve Existing Methods** (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). The hypothesis is that human-in-the-loop feedback can significantly improve the quality of LLM-generated code by incorporating human expertise. The reinforcement learning mechanism ensures that the system continuously improves over time, making it more effective and user-friendly.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLM-based code generation tools often lack the ability to incorporate human feedback in real-time, limiting their usability and effectiveness. By introducing human-in-the-loop feedback, this approach can significantly improve the quality of generated code and make the tools more user-friendly. The reinforcement learning mechanism ensures that the system continuously improves over time, making it a valuable tool for real-world programming tasks.",
