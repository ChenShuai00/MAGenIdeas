    "Title": "Hierarchical Multi-Perspective Consistency for Complex Code Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hierarchical MPSC framework that breaks down complex coding tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is addressed using the MPSC framework, and the solutions are then combined to solve the overall task. The hierarchical approach ensures that each sub-task is handled with high accuracy, leading to better overall performance on complex tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory and Quine’s holism. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller components, we can apply the MPSC framework more effectively, ensuring that each part of the task is handled correctly. The hierarchical approach aligns with the holistic view of problem-solving, ensuring that the overall task is addressed comprehensively.",
    "Rationale": "Complex coding tasks often require breaking down the problem into smaller parts. By applying the MPSC framework hierarchically, we can ensure that each sub-task is handled with high accuracy, leading to better overall performance on complex tasks. This approach is particularly useful for large-scale software development projects.",
