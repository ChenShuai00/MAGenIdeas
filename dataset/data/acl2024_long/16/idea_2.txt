    "Title": "Self-Refining Multi-Perspective Consistency with Human Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea integrates human feedback into the MPSC framework to refine the generated solutions. After the initial code generation, human developers review and provide feedback on the solutions, which is then used to fine-tune the model. The framework includes a feedback loop where the model learns from human corrections, improving its accuracy over time. This approach ensures that the model continuously improves and aligns with human expectations.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings and Sutton’s model of scientific serendipity. By incorporating human feedback, we can identify and correct anomalies in the generated solutions, leading to more accurate and reliable code generation. The feedback loop ensures that the model learns from its mistakes and improves iteratively.",
    "Rationale": "Human feedback is crucial for ensuring the correctness and quality of generated code. By integrating human feedback into the MPSC framework, we can create a model that not only generates code but also learns from human corrections, leading to continuous improvement and higher accuracy.",
