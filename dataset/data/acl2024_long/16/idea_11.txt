    "Title": "Unified Theoretical Framework for Multi-Perspective Consistency in Code Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a unified theoretical framework that integrates multiple perspectives (Solution, Specification, Test case) into a single cohesive model for code generation. The framework uses mathematical modeling to quantify the relationships between these perspectives and introduces a novel consistency metric that combines inter- and intra-consistency measures. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of programming tasks and evaluated on benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. The goal is to provide a robust theoretical foundation for multi-perspective consistency in LLM-based code generation, enabling more accurate and reliable code synthesis.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Construct and Modify Theoretical Models** (Quine’s holism) and **Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies** (Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory). The framework builds on the MPSC approach by unifying the three perspectives into a single model and introducing a mathematically rigorous consistency metric. This theoretical advancement addresses the lack of a unified framework in the target paper and provides a foundation for future research.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper introduces the MPSC framework but lacks a unified theoretical model that integrates the three perspectives. This idea fills that gap by providing a mathematically rigorous framework that can be applied to various code generation tasks. The consistency metric ensures that the generated code is not only diverse but also coherent and reliable, addressing a key challenge in LLM-based code generation.",
