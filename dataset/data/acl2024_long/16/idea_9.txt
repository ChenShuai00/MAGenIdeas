    "Title": "Meta-Learning for Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency in Code Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a meta-learning approach to multi-perspective self-consistency, where the model learns to adapt its self-consistency strategy based on the task at hand. The meta-learning framework trains the model to evaluate the effectiveness of different self-consistency strategies on a variety of tasks and select the most appropriate strategy for each new task. This adaptive approach ensures that the model can handle a wide range of coding tasks more effectively and produce more accurate and reliable code.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theory of 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions) and 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). The meta-learning approach represents a paradigm shift in self-consistency, where the model learns to adapt its strategy based on the task. The rationale is that different tasks may require different self-consistency strategies, and a one-size-fits-all approach may not be optimal.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that different coding tasks may require different self-consistency strategies, and a meta-learning approach can ensure that the model selects the most appropriate strategy for each task. This adaptive approach addresses a significant limitation of current self-consistency methods and has the potential to improve the reliability of code generation in real-world applications.",
