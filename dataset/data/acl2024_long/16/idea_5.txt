    "Title": "Dynamic Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency for Enhanced Code Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency (MPSC) framework by introducing dynamic weighting of perspectives based on the complexity and nature of the coding task. Instead of treating all perspectives (Solution, Specification, Test case) equally, the model dynamically adjusts the importance of each perspective during the generation process. This approach leverages the strengths of each perspective more effectively, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate code generation. The dynamic weighting is determined by a learned model that evaluates the task's requirements and the historical performance of each perspective on similar tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theory of 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) and 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method). The dynamic weighting mechanism is a novel hypothesis that aims to improve the existing MPSC framework by making it more adaptive and context-aware. The rationale is that different coding tasks may benefit more from certain perspectives, and a static weighting scheme may not capture this variability effectively.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale behind this idea is that current multi-perspective approaches treat all perspectives equally, which may not be optimal for all tasks. By dynamically adjusting the weights based on task complexity and historical performance, the model can better leverage the strengths of each perspective, leading to improved code generation accuracy and relevance. This approach also aligns with the broader trend in AI research towards more adaptive and context-aware models.",
