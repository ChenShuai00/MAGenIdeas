    "Title": "Anomaly-Driven Code Generation with Adaptive Feedback Loops",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces an anomaly-driven code generation approach where LLMs are trained to identify and correct anomalies in their own outputs. The system uses adaptive feedback loops to iteratively refine the generated code based on detected anomalies, such as syntax errors, logical inconsistencies, or performance inefficiencies. The feedback loops are guided by a combination of rule-based and learning-based anomaly detection mechanisms, ensuring that the system adapts to new types of errors over time. The approach is evaluated on benchmarks like CodeContests and APPS, with a focus on improving the robustness and reliability of LLM-generated code.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings** (Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings) and **Design and Improve Existing Methods** (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). The hypothesis is that anomaly-driven feedback loops can significantly improve the quality of LLM-generated code by addressing errors that are often overlooked in single-pass generation. The adaptive nature of the feedback loops ensures that the system continuously improves over time, making it more robust and reliable.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs often generate code with subtle errors that are difficult to detect without extensive testing. By introducing anomaly-driven feedback loops, this approach can identify and correct these errors in real-time, leading to more reliable and robust code generation. The adaptive nature of the system ensures that it can handle new types of errors, making it a valuable tool for complex programming tasks.",
