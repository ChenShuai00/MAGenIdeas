    "title": "Self-Supervised Knowledge Triplet Learning for Zero-shot Question Answering",
    "abstract": "The aim of all Question Answering (QA) systems is to be able to generalize to unseen questions. Current supervised methods are reliant on expensive data annotation. Moreover, such annotations can introduce unintended annotator bias which makes systems focus more on the bias than the actual task. In this work, we propose Knowledge Triplet Learning (KTL), a self-supervised task over knowledge graphs. We propose heuristics to create synthetic graphs for commonsense and scientific knowledge. We propose methods of how to use KTL to perform zero-shot QA and our experiments show considerable improvements over large pre-trained transformer models."
