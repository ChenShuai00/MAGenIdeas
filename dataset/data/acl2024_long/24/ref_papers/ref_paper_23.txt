    "title": "MISC: A Mixed Strategy-Aware Model integrating COMET for Emotional Support Conversation",
    "abstract": "Applying existing methods to emotional support conversation\u2014which provides valuable assistance to people who are in need\u2014has two major limitations: (a) they generally employ a conversation-level emotion label, which is too coarse-grained to capture user\u2019s instant mental state; (b) most of them focus on expressing empathy in the response(s) rather than gradually reducing user\u2019s distress. To address the problems, we propose a novel model \\textbf{MISC}, which firstly infers the user\u2019s fine-grained emotional status, and then responds skillfully using a mixture of strategy. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and reveal the benefits of fine-grained emotion understanding as well as mixed-up strategy modeling."
