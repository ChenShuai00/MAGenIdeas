    "title": "FolkScope: Intention Knowledge Graph Construction for Discovering E-commerce Commonsense",
    "abstract": "As stated by Oren Etzioni, \u201ccommonsense is the dark matter of artificial intelligence.\u201d In e-commerce, understanding users\u2019 needs or intentions requires substantial commonsense knowledge, e.g., \u201cA user bought an iPhone and a compatible case because the user wanted the phone to be protected.\u201d In this paper, we present FolkScope , an intention knowledge graph construction framework, to reveal the structure of humans\u2019 minds about purchasing items on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. As commonsense knowledge is usually ineffable and not expressed explicitly, it is challenging to perform any kind of information extraction. Thus, we propose a new approach that leverages the generation power of large language models and human-in-the-loop annotation to semi-automatically construct the knowledge graph. We annotate a large amount of assertions for both plausibility and typicality of an intention that can explain a purchasing or co-purchasing behavior, where the intention can be an open reason or a predicate falling into one of 18 categories aligning with ConceptNet, e.g., IsA , MadeOf , UsedFor , etc. Then we populate the annotated information to all automatically generated ones, and further structurize the assertions using pattern mining and conceptualization to form more condensed and abstractive knowledge. We evaluate our knowledge graph using both intrinsic quality measures and a downstream application, i.e., recommendation. The comprehensive study shows that our knowledge graph can well model e-commerce commonsense knowledge and can have many potential applications."
