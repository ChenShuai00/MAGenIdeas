    "title": "EcomEdit: An Automated E-commerce Knowledge Editing Framework for Enhanced Product and Purchase Intention Understanding",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Editing (KE) aims to correct and update factual information in Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure accuracy and relevance without computationally expensive fine-tuning. Though it has been proven effective in several domains, limited work has focused on its application within the e-commerce sector. However, there are naturally occurring scenarios that make KE necessary in this domain, such as the timely updating of product features and trending purchase intentions by customers, which necessitate further exploration. In this paper, we pioneer the application of KE in the e-commerce domain by presenting ECOMEDIT, an automated e-commerce knowledge editing framework tailored for e-commerce-related knowledge and tasks. Our framework leverages more powerful LLMs as judges to enable automatic knowledge conflict detection and incorporates conceptualization to enhance the semantic coverage of the knowledge to be edited. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ECOMEDIT in improving LLMs' understanding of product descriptions and purchase intentions. We also show that LLMs, after our editing, can achieve stronger performance on downstream e-commerce tasks."
