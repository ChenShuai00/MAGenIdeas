    "title": "FedAssistant: Dialog Agents with Two-side Modeling",
    "abstract": "The success of large pre-trained neural generative conversation models benefits from publicly available datasets of various sources. However, some high-quality datasets held by separated companies and organizations are not exploited yet due to security and privacy concerns. In this work, we demonstrate a framework named FedAssistant to address the above issue by training neural dialog systems in a federated learning setting. Our framework can be trained on multiple data owners with no raw data leakage during the process of training and evaluating the models. Moreover, our proposed FedAssis-tant with two-side modeling can be easily deployed to any user of all data providers. In order to reduce the communication cost between data holders and the parameter server, FedAssistant further implements Top-k gradient sparsification. We conduct quantitative experiments to evaluate the performance of FedAssistant on various domains, and our experiment shows that FedAssistant can obtain lower perplexity on all testing data with acceptable communication cost."
