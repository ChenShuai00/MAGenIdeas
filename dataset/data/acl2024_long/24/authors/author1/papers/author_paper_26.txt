    "title": "CAT: A Contextualized Conceptualization and Instantiation Framework for Commonsense Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Commonsense reasoning, aiming at endowing machines with a human-like ability to make situational presumptions, is extremely challenging to generalize.For someone who barely knows about \u201cmeditation,\u201d while is knowledgeable about \u201csinging,\u201d he can still infer that \u201cmeditation makes people relaxed\u201d from the existing knowledge that \u201csinging makes people relaxed\u201d by first conceptualizing \u201csinging\u201d as a \u201crelaxing event\u201d and then instantiating that event to \u201cmeditation.\u201dThis process, known as conceptual induction and deduction, is fundamental to commonsense reasoning while lacking both labeled data and methodologies to enhance commonsense modeling.To fill such a research gap, we propose CAT (Contextualized ConceptuAlization and InsTantiation),a semi-supervised learning framework that integrates event conceptualization and instantiation to conceptualize commonsense knowledge bases at scale.Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performances on two conceptualization tasks, and the acquired abstract commonsense knowledge can significantly improve commonsense inference modeling.Our code, data, and fine-tuned models are publicly available at [https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/CAT](https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/CAT)."
