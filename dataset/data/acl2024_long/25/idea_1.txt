    "Title": "Temporal Attention Mechanisms for Dynamic Language Modeling",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a temporal attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the model's focus based on the temporal context of the input text. The mechanism learns to weight historical and recent embeddings differently, allowing the model to adapt to temporal shifts in language use. This approach improves the model's ability to handle temporal misalignment and enhances performance on tasks requiring up-to-date knowledge.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Methodology 6: Construct and Modify Theoretical Models** (Lakoffâ€™s conceptual metaphor theory) and **Methodology 7: Designing Critical Experiments** (Bayesian experimental design theory). The theoretical model is modified to incorporate temporal attention, and critical experiments are designed to evaluate its effectiveness in handling temporal shifts.",
    "Rationale": "Existing language models struggle with temporal misalignment, as they are trained on static datasets. The proposed temporal attention mechanism addresses this limitation by dynamically adjusting the model's focus based on temporal context. This idea is impactful because it improves the temporal robustness of language models and has applications in real-time NLP systems, such as chatbots and recommendation systems.",
