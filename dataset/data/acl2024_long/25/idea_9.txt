    "Title": "Temporal Ensemble Learning: Combining Time-Specialized Models for Robust Predictions",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes Temporal Ensemble Learning (TEL), a method that combines multiple time-specialized models (e.g., models finetuned on different time periods) into a single ensemble model. The ensemble model dynamically weights the predictions of each time-specialized model based on the temporal context of the input text. This approach leverages the strengths of individual time-specialized models while mitigating their weaknesses, resulting in more robust and accurate predictions across different time periods.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**. The improvement model is used to enhance the existing time vector approach by introducing ensemble learning, a well-established technique in machine learning. Kuhn’s theory is used to identify the anomaly of temporal misalignment as a critical problem that can be addressed through ensemble learning.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for TEL is that individual time-specialized models may perform well on specific time periods but poorly on others. By combining these models into an ensemble, we can achieve more robust and accurate predictions across different time periods. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the temporal generalization of language models, making them more reliable for real-world applications.",
