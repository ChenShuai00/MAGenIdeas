    "Title": "Temporal Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Model Updates",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a method for distilling temporal knowledge from a large, temporally finetuned model into a smaller, more efficient model. The distillation process would focus on capturing the temporal dynamics encoded in the weights of the large model, allowing the smaller model to retain the ability to handle text from different time periods without the computational cost of finetuning on large datasets.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' theory (Quine’s holism, Kitcher’s unified theory of science). The target paper shows that temporal information is encoded in the weights of finetuned models, and this idea builds on that by exploring how this information can be distilled into smaller models. The rationale is that by distilling temporal knowledge, we can create more efficient models that are still capable of handling temporal dynamics, making them more practical for real-world applications.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that large language models are computationally expensive to finetune and deploy, especially when temporal updates are required. By distilling temporal knowledge into smaller models, we can reduce the computational cost of maintaining up-to-date models while still preserving their ability to handle temporal dynamics.",
