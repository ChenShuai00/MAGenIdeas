    "Title": "Temporal Embedding Visualization for Interpretable Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a visualization framework for temporal embeddings, allowing researchers and practitioners to interpret how language models encode temporal information. The framework uses dimensionality reduction techniques to project temporal embeddings into a 2D or 3D space, highlighting patterns and trends in temporal language use. This approach enhances the interpretability of temporal language models and provides insights into semantic changes over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Methodology 5: Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies** (Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory) and **Methodology 10: Scientific Paradigm Shift** (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions). The visualization framework synthesizes insights from multiple studies on temporal embeddings, and the paradigm shift lies in making temporal encoding interpretable.",
    "Rationale": "Current temporal language models lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how they encode temporal information. The proposed visualization framework addresses this limitation by providing a tool for exploring and interpreting temporal embeddings. This idea is impactful because it bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, enabling better understanding and utilization of temporal language models.",
