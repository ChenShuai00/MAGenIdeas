    "Title": "Temporal Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Model Updates",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a knowledge distillation framework where a large, temporally fine-tuned model (teacher) distills its knowledge into a smaller, more efficient model (student) for new time periods. The student model is trained to mimic the teacher's predictions while being lightweight and computationally efficient. This approach enables efficient updates to language models without the need for full retraining.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Methodology 4: Design and Improve Existing Methods** (Hacking’s experimental system theory) and **Methodology 9: Evaluating and Selecting Competing Theories** (Laudan’s problem-solving progress assessment). The improvement lies in reducing the computational cost of model updates, and the evaluation focuses on comparing the performance of the student model with the teacher model.",
    "Rationale": "Retraining large language models for new time periods is resource-intensive. Temporal knowledge distillation provides a cost-effective solution by transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller one. This idea is significant because it enables frequent updates to language models, ensuring they remain relevant and accurate over time.",
