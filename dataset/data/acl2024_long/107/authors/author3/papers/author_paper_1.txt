    "title": "KOR-Bench: Benchmarking Language Models on Knowledge-Orthogonal Reasoning Tasks",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Knowledge-Orthogonal Reasoning (KOR), which minimizes the impact of domain-specific knowledge for a more accurate evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in out-of-distribution scenarios. Based on this concept, we propose the Knowledge-Orthogonal Reasoning Benchmark (KOR-Bench), encompassing five task categories: Operation, Logic, Cipher, Puzzle, and Counterfactual. KOR-Bench emphasizes the effectiveness of models in applying new rule descriptions to solve novel rule-driven questions. O1-Preview and O1-Mini achieve accuracies of 72.88% and 70.16%, significantly outperforming Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o, which score 58.96% and 58.00%, revealing considerable performance gaps and highlighting KOR-Bench's effectiveness. We conduct thorough analyses to identify bottlenecks in the Cipher task using Stepwise Prompting, discovering that two rounds of Self-Correction yield optimal results. Complex Task Processing evaluates model performance across three integrated tasks, while we also explore the impact of Tricks on the Puzzle task and visualize rule-focused attention to enhance our understanding of model behavior. KOR-Bench aims to enhance reasoning evaluation and support further research in this field."
