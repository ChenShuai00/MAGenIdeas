    "title": "DreamEdit: Subject-driven Image Editing",
    "abstract": "Subject-driven image generation aims at generating images containing customized subjects, which has recently drawn enormous attention from the research community. However, the previous works cannot precisely control the background and position of the target subject. In this work, we aspire to fill the void and propose two novel subject-driven sub-tasks, i.e., Subject Replacement and Subject Addition. The new tasks are challenging in multiple aspects: replacing a subject with a customized one can change its shape, texture, and color, while adding a target subject to a designated position in a provided scene necessitates a context-aware posture. To conquer these two novel tasks, we first manually curate a new dataset DreamEditBench containing 22 different types of subjects, and 440 source images with different difficulty levels. We plan to host DreamEditBench as a platform and hire trained evaluators for standard human evaluation. We also devise an innovative method DreamEditor to resolve these tasks by performing iterative generation, which enables a smooth adaptation to the customized subject. In this project, we conduct automatic and human evaluations to understand the performance of DreamEditor and baselines on DreamEditBench. For Subject Replacement, we found that the existing models are sensitive to the shape and color of the original subject. The model failure rate will dramatically increase when the source and target subjects are highly different. For Subject Addition, we found that the existing models cannot easily blend the customized subjects into the background smoothly, leading to noticeable artifacts in the generated image. We hope DreamEditBench can become a standard platform to enable future investigations toward building more controllable subject-driven image editing.
