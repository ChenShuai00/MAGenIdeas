    "title": "Solving Math Word Problem via Cooperative Reasoning induced Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) bring new opportunities to challenge problems, especially those that need high-level intelligence, such as the math word problem (MWPs). However, directly applying existing PLMs to MWPs can fail as the generation process lacks suf\ufb01cient supervision and thus lacks fast adaptivity as humans. We notice that human reasoning has a dual reasoning framework that consists of an immediate reaction system (system 1) and a delicate reasoning system (system 2), where the entire reasoning is determined by their interaction. This inspires us to develop a cooperative reasoning-induced PLM for solving MWPs, called Co operative Re asoning (CoRe), resulting in a human-like reasoning architecture with system 1 as the generator and system 2 as the veri\ufb01er. In our approach, the generator is responsible for generating reasoning paths, and the veri\ufb01ers are used to supervise the evaluation in order to obtain reliable feedback for the generator. We evaluate our CoRe framework on several mathematical reasoning datasets and achieve decent improvement over state-of-the-art methods, up to 9.8% increase over best baselines."
