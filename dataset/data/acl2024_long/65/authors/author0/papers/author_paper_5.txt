    "title": "RESEMO: A Benchmark Chinese Dataset for Studying Responsive Emotion from Social Media Content",
    "abstract": "On social media platforms, users\u2019 emotions are triggered when they encounter particular content from other users, where such emotions are different from those that spontaneously emerged, owing to the \u201cresponsive\u201d nature. Analyzing the aforementioned responsive emotions from user interactions is a task of significant importance for understanding human cognition, the mechanisms of emotion generation, behavior on the Internet, etc. Performing the task with artificial intelligence generally requires human-annotated data to help train a well-performing system, while existing data resources do not cover this specific area, with none of them focusing on responsive emotion analysis. In this paper, we propose a Chinese dataset named R ES E MO for responsive emotion analysis, including 3,813 posts with 68,781 comments collected from Weibo, the largest social media platform in China. R ES E MO contains three types of human annotations with respect to responsive emotions, namely, responsive relationship, responsive emotion cause, and responsive emotion category. Moreover, to test this dataset, we build large language model (LLM) baseline methods for responsive relation extraction, responsive emotion cause extraction, and responsive emotion detection, which show the potential of the proposed R E - S E MO being a benchmark for future studies on responsive emotions."
