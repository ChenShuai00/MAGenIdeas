    "title": "Harnessing the Power of ChatGPT in Fake News: An In-Depth Exploration in Generation, Detection and Explanation",
    "abstract": "The rampant spread of fake news has adversely affected society, resulting in extensive research on curbing its spread. As a notable milestone in large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT has gained significant attention due to its exceptional natural language processing capabilities. In this study, we present a thorough exploration of ChatGPT\u2019s proficiency in generating, explaining, and detecting fake news as follows. Generation \u2013 We employ four prompt methods to generate fake news samples and prove the high quality of these samples through both self-assessment and human evaluation. Explanation \u2013 We obtain nine features to characterize fake news based on ChatGPT\u2019s explanations and analyze the distribution of these factors across multiple public datasets. Detection \u2013 We examine ChatGPT\u2019s capacity to identify fake news. We explore its detection consistency and then propose a reason-aware prompt method to improve its performance. Although our experiments demonstrate that ChatGPT shows commendable performance in detecting fake news, there is still room for its improvement. Consequently, we further probe into the potential extra information that could bolster its effectiveness in detecting fake news."
