    "title": "Safe Unlearning: A Surprisingly Effective and Generalizable Solution to Defend Against Jailbreak Attacks",
    "abstract": "LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, even after safety alignment. An important observation is that, while different types of jailbreak attacks can generate significantly different queries, they mostly result in similar responses that are rooted in the same harmful knowledge (e.g., detailed steps to make a bomb). Therefore, we conjecture that directly unlearn the harmful knowledge in the LLM can be a more effective way to defend against jailbreak attacks than the mainstream supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the surprising generalizability of our unlearning-based approach: using only 20 raw harmful questions without any jailbreak prompt during training, our solution reduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in Vicuna-7B from 82.6% to 7.7% on out-of-distribution (OOD) harmful questions wrapped with various complex jailbreak prompts . This significantly outperforms Llama2-7B-Chat, which is fine-tuned on about 0.1M safety alignment samples but still has an ASR of 21.9% even under the help of an additional safety system prompt. Further analysis reveals that the generalization ability of our solution may stem from the intrinsic relatedness among harmful responses across harmful questions (e.g., response patterns, shared steps and actions in response, and similarity among their learned representations in the LLM).
