    "title": "ARAML: A Stable Adversarial Training Framework for Text Generation",
    "abstract": "Most of the existing generative adversarial networks (GAN) for text generation suffer from the instability of reinforcement learning training algorithms such as policy gradient, leading to unstable performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework called Adversarial Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood (ARAML). During adversarial training, the discriminator assigns rewards to samples which are acquired from a stationary distribution near the data rather than the generator\u2019s distribution. The generator is optimized with maximum likelihood estimation augmented by the discriminator\u2019s rewards instead of policy gradient. Experiments show that our model can outperform state-of-the-art text GANs with a more stable training process."
