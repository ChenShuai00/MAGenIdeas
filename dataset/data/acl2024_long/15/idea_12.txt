    "Title": "Dynamic Synthetic Data Generation for Adaptive Continual Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic synthetic data generation framework that adapts to the model's learning progress. The framework uses reinforcement learning to adjust the synthetic data generation process based on the model's performance on previous tasks. The reinforcement learning agent selects the most relevant synthetic data samples for rehearsal, ensuring that the model focuses on areas where it is most likely to forget. The framework also incorporates a diversity metric to ensure that the synthetic data covers a wide range of scenarios.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method and Laudan’s methodological improvement model. Pierce’s method suggests using creative leaps, such as reinforcement learning, to propose new hypotheses. Laudan’s model emphasizes improving existing methods by integrating new technologies, such as reinforcement learning, to enhance the adaptability of synthetic data generation.",
    "Rationale": "Static synthetic data generation methods may not adapt to the model's changing needs during continual learning. By introducing a dynamic framework, this idea ensures that the model receives the most relevant synthetic data at each stage of learning. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the selection of synthetic data, improving the model's ability to retain knowledge and adapt to new tasks.",
