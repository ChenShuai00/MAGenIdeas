    "Title": "Self-Supervised Continual Learning with Synthetic Data Augmentation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a self-supervised continual learning framework that integrates synthetic data augmentation (SSDA) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. SSDA leverages self-supervised learning techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data that preserves the semantic structure of the original data. The framework employs a self-supervised loss function that ensures the generated data is semantically consistent with the original data, enhancing the model's ability to retain knowledge across tasks. Additionally, SSDA incorporates a dynamic data selection mechanism that prioritizes synthetic instances based on their relevance to the current task, further reducing catastrophic forgetting.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' and 'Propose New Hypotheses' theories. The SSR framework in the target paper relies on supervised learning for synthetic data generation, which may limit its effectiveness in self-supervised scenarios. By integrating self-supervised learning techniques, SSDA enhances the quality of synthetic data and improves the model's ability to retain knowledge across tasks. The dynamic data selection mechanism is a novel contribution that further enhances the framework's effectiveness.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that self-supervised learning techniques can enhance the quality of synthetic data and improve the model's ability to retain knowledge across tasks. By integrating self-supervised learning into the SSR framework, SSDA addresses the limitations of supervised synthetic data generation and provides a more effective solution for continual learning. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of LLMs in self-supervised continual learning scenarios, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
