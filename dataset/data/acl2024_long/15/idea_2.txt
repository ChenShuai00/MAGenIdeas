    "Title": "Neurosymbolic Self-Synthesized Rehearsal for Continual Learning in Large Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a neurosymbolic extension of the SSR framework that combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to improve the generation of synthetic data. The key innovation is the use of symbolic rules to guide the generation of synthetic instances, ensuring that the generated data is not only diverse but also logically consistent. The proposed method is evaluated on a suite of continual learning benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the scientific discovery theories of 'Propose New Hypotheses' and 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models.' The SSR framework is extended by integrating symbolic reasoning, which is a novel addition that addresses the limitations of purely neural approaches. The use of symbolic rules to guide the generation of synthetic data is a creative leap that draws on Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method, which emphasizes the use of analogical reasoning and creative leaps to propose new hypotheses. This approach also aligns with Kitcher’s unified theory of science by combining insights from neuroscience and symbolic reasoning to create a more comprehensive approach to continual learning.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current rehearsal-based methods, including SSR, often generate synthetic data that is not logically consistent, leading to poor retention of knowledge. By introducing symbolic rules, the synthetic data generation process becomes more logically consistent, leading to better retention of knowledge. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce catastrophic forgetting and improve the generalization capabilities of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like NeurIPS and ICLR.",
