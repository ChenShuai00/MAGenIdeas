    "Title": "Cross-Domain Self-Synthesized Rehearsal for Generalizable Continual Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the SSR framework by introducing a cross-domain self-synthesized rehearsal mechanism that leverages knowledge from multiple domains to generate synthetic data. The key innovation is the use of domain-specific prompts and cross-domain attention mechanisms to guide the generation of synthetic instances, ensuring that the generated data is not only diverse but also generalizable across domains. The proposed method is evaluated on a suite of cross-domain continual learning benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the scientific discovery theories of 'Define New Scientific Problems' and 'Abstract and Summarize General Laws.' The SSR framework is extended to address the challenge of cross-domain continual learning, which is a new problem that arises from the limitations of the original method. The use of domain-specific prompts and cross-domain attention mechanisms is a novel approach that draws on Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory, which emphasizes the identification of common patterns across multiple studies. This approach also aligns with Kuhn’s paradigm theory by addressing a new scientific problem that has not been fully explored in the context of continual learning.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current rehearsal-based methods, including SSR, often fail to generalize across domains, leading to poor performance in cross-domain continual learning scenarios. By introducing domain-specific prompts and cross-domain attention mechanisms, the synthetic data generation process becomes more generalizable, leading to better retention of knowledge across domains. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the generalization capabilities of LLMs in cross-domain continual learning, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like ACL and CVPR.",
