    "Title": "Multi-Agent Self-Synthesized Rehearsal for Continual Learning in Large Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-agent extension of the SSR framework that leverages multiple agents to collaboratively generate synthetic data. The key innovation is the use of a multi-agent system where each agent specializes in generating synthetic data for a specific subset of tasks, ensuring that the generated data is not only diverse but also highly relevant to each task. The proposed method is evaluated on a suite of continual learning benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the scientific discovery theories of 'Propose New Hypotheses' and 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models.' The SSR framework is extended by integrating a multi-agent system, which is a novel addition that addresses the limitations of the original method. The use of multiple agents to collaboratively generate synthetic data is a creative leap that draws on Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method, which emphasizes the use of analogical reasoning and creative leaps to propose new hypotheses. This approach also aligns with Kitcher’s unified theory of science by combining insights from multi-agent systems and continual learning to create a more comprehensive approach.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current rehearsal-based methods, including SSR, often generate synthetic data that is not optimally aligned with the specific requirements of each task. By introducing a multi-agent system, the synthetic data generation process becomes more targeted, leading to better retention of task-specific knowledge. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce catastrophic forgetting and improve the generalization capabilities of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like NeurIPS and ICLR.",
