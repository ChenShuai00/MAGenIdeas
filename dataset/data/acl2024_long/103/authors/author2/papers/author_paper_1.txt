    "abstract": "Abstract. The anti-missile interception technique of unpowered phase is of much importance in the military field, which depends on the prediction of the missile trajectory and the establishment of the missile model. With rapid development of data science field and large amounts of available data observed, there are more and more powerful data-driven methods proposed recently in discovering governing equations of complex systems. In this work, we introduce an anti-missile interception technique via a data-driven method based on Koopman operator theory. More specifically, we describe the dynamical model of the missile established by classical mechanics to generate the trajectorial data. Then we perform the data-driven method based on Koopman operator to identify the governing equations for the position and velocity of the missile. Numerical experiments show that the trajectories of the learned model agree well with the ones of the true model. The effectiveness and accuracy of this technique suggest that it will be realized in practical applications of anti-missile interception."
