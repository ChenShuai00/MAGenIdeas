    "Title": "Explainable Multi-Agent Reasoning: Generating Human-Interpretable Explanations for Consensus Decisions",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an explainable multi-agent reasoning framework where agents not only reach a consensus but also generate human-interpretable explanations for their decisions. Each agent would provide a rationale for its answer, and a synthesizer agent would combine these rationales into a coherent explanation. The framework would be evaluated on tasks requiring high interpretability, such as medical diagnosis or legal reasoning, with the goal of achieving both high accuracy and explainability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the importance of re-examining neglected problems, such as the interpretability of AI systems. Current multi-agent frameworks focus on accuracy but often lack explainability. By generating human-interpretable explanations, we can address this gap and create a more trustworthy reasoning system. Additionally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is used to design the explanation generation mechanism, ensuring that it is both effective and scalable.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that explainability is critical for the adoption of AI systems in high-stakes applications. By generating human-interpretable explanations, we can increase the transparency and trustworthiness of multi-agent reasoning frameworks. This would make the framework more applicable to real-world tasks, increasing its practical impact and potential for recognition at top conferences."
