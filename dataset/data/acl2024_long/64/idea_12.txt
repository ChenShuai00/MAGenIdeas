    "Title": "Interdisciplinary Reasoning: Integrating Domain-Specific Knowledge into Multi-Agent LLM Frameworks",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an interdisciplinary reasoning framework where domain-specific LLMs (e.g., medical, legal, or scientific models) are integrated into the multi-agent system. Each domain-specific agent would contribute its specialized knowledge to the discussion, while a generalist agent would coordinate the debate and ensure coherence. The framework would be evaluated on tasks that require both general reasoning and domain-specific expertise, such as medical diagnosis or legal case analysis. The goal is to achieve superior performance by leveraging the strengths of both generalist and domain-specific models.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the integration of interdisciplinary knowledge to discover new problems and solutions. Current multi-agent frameworks primarily use generalist LLMs, which may lack the depth of domain-specific knowledge required for certain tasks. By integrating domain-specific models, we can address this limitation and create a more versatile reasoning system. Additionally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is used to design the coordination mechanism, ensuring that the framework can effectively combine diverse sources of knowledge.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that many real-world reasoning tasks require both general and domain-specific knowledge. By integrating domain-specific LLMs into the multi-agent framework, we can achieve more accurate and contextually relevant results. This would make the framework applicable to a wider range of tasks, increasing its practical impact and potential for recognition at top conferences."
