    "Title": "Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reasoning with Task Decomposition",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hierarchical multi-agent reasoning framework where complex tasks are decomposed into subtasks, each handled by specialized agents. The framework would use a 'task decomposition module' to break down the main task into smaller, more manageable components, which would then be assigned to agents based on their expertise. The results from each subtask would be integrated using a 'consensus aggregation module' that ensures consistency and coherence across the final solution. The framework would also incorporate a 'dynamic task reallocation mechanism' to reassign subtasks if an agent struggles or fails to produce a reliable result. This approach would improve the scalability and efficiency of multi-agent reasoning systems, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning or domain-specific knowledge.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** and **Quine’s holism**. Whewell’s theory emphasizes the importance of synthesizing knowledge from multiple sources, while Quine’s holism highlights the interconnectedness of knowledge and the need for coherence in reasoning. By decomposing tasks and integrating results from specialized agents, this idea addresses the limitations of current multi-agent systems, which often struggle with complex, multi-step tasks. The dynamic task reallocation mechanism further enhances the framework's adaptability and robustness.",
    "Rationale": "Current multi-agent systems like ReConcile are effective for collaborative reasoning but may struggle with complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning or domain-specific expertise. By introducing task decomposition and specialized agents, this idea ensures that each subtask is handled by the most capable agent, leading to more accurate and efficient reasoning. The dynamic task reallocation mechanism further enhances the framework's ability to handle unexpected challenges, such as agent failures or ambiguous subtasks. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the scalability and performance of multi-agent reasoning systems, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
