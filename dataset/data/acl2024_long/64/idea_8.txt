    "Title": "Adaptive Multi-Agent Reasoning: Dynamic Model Selection for Optimal Consensus",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an adaptive multi-agent reasoning framework where the composition of the agent team is dynamically adjusted based on the problem at hand. The framework uses a meta-reasoning module to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each agent and selects the optimal combination of agents for each problem. The selected agents then engage in a round-table discussion, and their confidence scores are dynamically adjusted based on their performance. The framework also introduces an 'adaptive feedback loop' where the meta-reasoning module continuously evaluates the agents' performance and adjusts the team composition in real-time, leading to more accurate and efficient reasoning outcomes.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' (Theory 6) and 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Theory 4) methodologies. The target paper uses a fixed set of agents, but this idea proposes a dynamic model selection mechanism to optimize the reasoning process. The rationale is that different problems may require different combinations of agents, and dynamically adjusting the team composition can lead to more accurate and efficient reasoning. This approach aligns with the target paper's goal of improving reasoning through collaboration and consensus, while also addressing the challenge of integrating diverse models with different capabilities (Theory 8). The adaptive feedback loop ensures that the reasoning process is continuously optimized, leading to more robust outcomes.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current multi-agent reasoning frameworks, including ReConcile, use a fixed set of agents, which may not be optimal for all problems. By introducing a dynamic model selection mechanism, the framework can adapt to the specific requirements of each problem and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the reasoning process. This approach also addresses the challenge of integrating diverse models with different capabilities, which is critical for achieving robust reasoning outcomes. The potential impact of this idea is significant, as it could lead to a new paradigm in adaptive reasoning (Theory 10) and improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences."
