    "title": "Accurate Vision-based Localization by Transferring Between Ground and Satellite Images",
    "abstract": "We present a method for accurately localizing a ground image with the aid of satellite imagery by transferring between the two image modalities. We perform visual localization by estimating the co-occurrence probabilities between the ground and satellite images. This method allows us to estimate location probabilities at arbitrary locations, thus enabling more information for accurate localization without expanding the ground-image database. We also propose a ranking-based algorithm to learn location-discriminative feature projection matrices that result in further improvements in accuracy. We evaluate our method on the Malaga [2] and KITTI [9] datasets and demonstrate significant improvements."
