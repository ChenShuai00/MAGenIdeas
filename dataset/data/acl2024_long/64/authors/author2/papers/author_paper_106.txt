    "title": "Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Recognition using Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "Identification of the plant diseases is the key to prevent the losses in the yield and quantity of the agricultural product. The studies of the plant diseases mean the studies of visually\u00a0 observable\u00a0 patterns seen\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 plant.\u00a0 Health monitoring and disease detection\u00a0 on plant is\u00a0 very critical for sustainable agriculture. It is very difficult to monitor the plant diseases\u00a0 manually. It requires tremendous amount of work, expertise in the plant diseases, and\u00a0 also require the excessive processing\u00a0 time. Hence, image processing\u00a0 is\u00a0 used\u00a0 for\u00a0 the detection\u00a0 of\u00a0 plant\u00a0 diseases by capturing\u00a0 the\u00a0 images\u00a0 of\u00a0 the leaves\u00a0 and comparing\u00a0 it\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 data\u00a0 sets.\u00a0 The\u00a0 data\u00a0 set consist\u00a0 of different\u00a0 plant\u00a0 in the\u00a0 image format. For Result Implementation we use Three method. 1.Single Image Prediction 2.Graphical User Interface (GUI) Method 3.Through Local Host leaf disease detection. First two method use for seeing our model or project work properly and only admin can access these two method. Last Method is use for another user who just want to know Leaf disease category then they can upload their affected leaf image and\u00a0 predict the disease category. This project help farmers to check the disease of their plant leaf in early stage and prevent their plants from these disease using various medicine. Farmers can check medicine according to disease categories."
