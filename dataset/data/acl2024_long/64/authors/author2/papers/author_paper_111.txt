    "title": "Dual Reinforcement-Based Specification Generation for Image De-Rendering",
    "abstract": "Advances in deep learning have led to promising progress in inferring graphics programs by de-rendering computer-generated images. However, current methods do not explore which decoding methods lead to better inductive bias for inferring graphics programs. In our work, we first explore the effectiveness of LSTM-RNN versus Transformer networks as decoders for order-independent graphics programs. Since these are sequence models, we must choose an ordering of the objects in the graphics programs for likelihood training. We found that the LSTM performance was highly sensitive to the sequence ordering (random order vs. pattern-based order), while Transformer performance was roughly independent of the sequence ordering. Further, we present a policy gradient based reinforcement learning approach for better inductive bias in the decoder via multiple diverse rewards based both on the graphics program specification and the rendered image. We also explore the combination of these complementary rewards. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two graphics program generation datasets."
