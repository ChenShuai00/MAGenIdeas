    "title": "iFacetSum: Coreference-based Interactive Faceted Summarization for Multi-Document Exploration",
    "abstract": "We introduce iF\u1d00\u1d04\u1d07\u1d1bS\u1d1c\u1d0d, a web application for exploring topical document collections. iF\u1d00\u1d04\u1d07\u1d1bS\u1d1c\u1d0d integrates interactive summarization together with faceted search, by providing a novel faceted navigation scheme that yields abstractive summaries for the user\u2019s selections. This approach offers both a comprehensive overview as well as particular details regard-ing subtopics of choice. The facets are automatically produced based on cross-document coreference pipelines, rendering generic concepts, entities and statements surfacing in the source texts. We analyze the effectiveness of our application through small-scale user studies that suggest the usefulness of our tool."
