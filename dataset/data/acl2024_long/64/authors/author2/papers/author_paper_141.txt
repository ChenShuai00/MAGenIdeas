(India) ---------------------------------------------------------------------***--------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract In this work we have synthesized four derivatives of benzene-1,4-bis(diazonium) by coupling of various naphthols with diazonium salt of p-phenylenediamine. The experimental procedure was simple and had a high reaction rate and excellent yield. These synthesized benzene-1,4-bis(diazonium) dyes were studied for dyeing on polyester fabric. The fastness results of dyed polyester were good to better comparable with that of commercial dye."
