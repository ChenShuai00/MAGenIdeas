    "title": "ANALYSIS OF SPEECH RECOGNITION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK",
    "abstract": "\u2014 Nowadays in the current world, speech recognition has gained prominence and use with the rise of AI and intelligent assistants, such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google assistant. Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or a program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to a machine-readable format. Speech recognition has many applications such as voice dialing, call routing, search keywords, simple data entry. The research aims to compare the performance to identify the best model between the two neural networks i.e., CNN (convolution neural network) and basic Neural Network for speech recognition. To find the best model among CNN and basic NN the audio data is collected from the internet and noise elimination on the audio data and data should be cleaned for further process, then the cleaned audio data is fed into CNN or basic NN architecture and trained with different layers. Finally, the trained model is checked for accuracy, validation accuracy and then the trained data is tested with test data to check test accuracy of a given Model."
