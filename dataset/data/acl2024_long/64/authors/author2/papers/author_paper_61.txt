    "title": "Evaluation and Ranking of E-Government Websites Using Weighted-Combinative Distance-Based Assessment Approach",
    "abstract": "Electronic government (e-government) now becomes a necessity rather than an option for the countries that aim for improved governance. Indeed, existing agencies of government make a powerful connection with customers through e-government to deliver better, cheaper, and faster services. In the present research, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, namely weighted-combinative distance-based assessment (W-CODAS), is proposed which is a combination of Shannon entropy approach and CODAS and implemented to rank the e-government websites of eight countries by selecting 15 evaluation criteria. Further, the results obtained from W-CODAS method are compared with well-known methods AHP and TOPSIS and validated by Kendall's tau correlation test. The results of the present research based on W-CODAS show that the e-government website of Finland is placed at the top position (Rank 1) followed by UK. Similarly, the Netherlands website occupies last position and is ranked at number eight."
