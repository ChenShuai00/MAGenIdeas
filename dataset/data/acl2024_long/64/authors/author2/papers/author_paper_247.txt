    "title": "Generating Realtime Motion Plans from Attribute-Based Natural Language Instructions Using Dynamic Constraint Mapping",
    "abstract": "We present an algorithm for combining natural language processing (NLP) and realtime robot motion planning to automatically generate safe robot movements. Our formulation uses novel a Dynamic Constraint Mapping to transform the complex, attribute-based natural language instructions into appropriate cost functions and parametric constraints for optimization-based motion planning. We generate a factor graph called Dynamic Grounding Graph (DGG) from natural language instructions that takes into account the latent parameters. The coefficients of this factor graph are learned based on conditional random fields (CRFs) and are used to dynamically generate the constraints for motion planning. We directly map the cost function to the motion parameters of the planner and compute smooth trajectories in dynamic scenes. We highlight the performance of our approach in a simulated environment as well as via a human interacting with a 7-DOF Fetch robot using intricate language commands that include negation, orientation specification, and distance constraints."
