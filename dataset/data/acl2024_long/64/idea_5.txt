    "Title": "Confidence-Aware Multi-Agent Reasoning with Dynamic Feedback Loops",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a new framework that integrates dynamic confidence calibration and iterative feedback loops into the multi-agent reasoning process. Each agent in the framework not only generates answers but also provides a confidence score and a rationale for its decision. These confidence scores are dynamically adjusted based on the feedback from other agents and external validation mechanisms. The framework also introduces a 'confidence-weighted consensus' mechanism, where the final answer is determined not just by majority voting but by a weighted combination of answers based on the agents' confidence levels. Additionally, the framework incorporates a feedback loop where agents iteratively refine their answers based on the confidence-weighted consensus, leading to more accurate and robust reasoning outcomes.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Theory 4) and 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Theory 2) methodologies. The target paper, ReConcile, already uses a confidence-weighted voting mechanism, but this idea extends it by introducing dynamic confidence calibration and iterative feedback loops. The rationale is that confidence scores are not static and should be adjusted based on the evolving consensus and external validation. This approach aligns with the target paper's goal of improving reasoning through collaboration and consensus, while also addressing potential anomalies in confidence estimation (Theory 8). The iterative feedback loop ensures that agents continuously refine their answers, leading to a more robust and accurate reasoning process.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current multi-agent reasoning frameworks, including ReConcile, rely on static confidence scores and majority voting, which may not fully capture the nuances of each agent's reasoning process. By introducing dynamic confidence calibration and iterative feedback loops, the framework can better adapt to the evolving consensus and improve the accuracy of the final answer. This approach also addresses the challenge of integrating diverse models with varying levels of confidence, which is critical for achieving robust reasoning outcomes. The potential impact of this idea is significant, as it could lead to a new paradigm in multi-agent reasoning (Theory 10) and improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences."
