    "Title": "Multimodal Multi-Agent Reasoning: Integrating Vision and Language for Enhanced Consensus",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the ReConcile framework to include multimodal reasoning by integrating vision and language models. In this framework, each agent can process both textual and visual inputs, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the problem. The agents engage in a round-table discussion where they not only share their textual reasoning but also provide visual explanations or annotations to support their arguments. The confidence-weighted voting mechanism is extended to include both textual and visual confidence scores, leading to a more robust consensus. The framework also introduces a 'multimodal feedback loop' where agents iteratively refine their answers based on both textual and visual feedback from other agents.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' (Theory 10) and 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' (Theory 6) methodologies. The target paper focuses on textual reasoning, but this idea proposes a paradigm shift by integrating multimodal reasoning into the framework. The rationale is that many real-world problems require both textual and visual understanding, and integrating these modalities can lead to more accurate and comprehensive reasoning. This approach aligns with the target paper's goal of improving reasoning through collaboration and consensus, while also addressing the challenge of integrating diverse models with different capabilities (Theory 8). The multimodal feedback loop ensures that agents continuously refine their answers based on both textual and visual inputs, leading to a more robust reasoning process.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current multi-agent reasoning frameworks, including ReConcile, are limited to textual reasoning, which may not be sufficient for complex real-world problems that require both textual and visual understanding. By integrating vision and language models, the framework can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and improve the accuracy of the final answer. This approach also addresses the challenge of integrating diverse models with different capabilities, which is critical for achieving robust reasoning outcomes. The potential impact of this idea is significant, as it could lead to a new paradigm in multimodal reasoning (Theory 10) and improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences."
