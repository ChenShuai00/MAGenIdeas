    "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Multi-Agent Debate: Improving Truthfulness in LLM Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a confidence-calibration mechanism into multi-agent debate frameworks like ReConcile. Each agent would not only provide answers and explanations but also output a calibrated confidence score based on its certainty. A meta-agent would then aggregate these confidence scores and use them to weight the final consensus decision. The calibration process would involve training agents to align their confidence scores with the likelihood of correctness, using techniques from Bayesian calibration and adversarial training. This approach would be evaluated on tasks requiring high factual accuracy, such as mathematical reasoning and fact verification.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, which involves proposing new hypotheses to address existing limitations. Current multi-agent frameworks do not explicitly account for the confidence of individual agents, which can lead to suboptimal consensus decisions. By introducing confidence calibration, we can improve the truthfulness and reliability of the final output. Additionally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is used to design the calibration mechanism, ensuring that it is both effective and scalable.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that confidence calibration is critical for trustworthy decision-making in AI systems. By incorporating confidence scores into multi-agent debates, we can reduce errors caused by overconfident or underconfident agents. This would make the framework more robust and reliable, particularly in high-stakes applications like medical diagnosis or legal reasoning. The novelty and practical impact of this idea make it a strong contender for best paper awards."
