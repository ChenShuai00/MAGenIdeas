    "Title": "Dynamic Role Assignment in Multi-Agent Reasoning: Optimizing Collaboration through Adaptive Agent Roles",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic role assignment mechanism for multi-agent reasoning frameworks. Instead of fixed roles, agents would be assigned roles (e.g., proposer, critic, or synthesizer) based on their performance and the requirements of the task. A meta-agent would monitor the debate and dynamically reassign roles to optimize collaboration and reasoning efficiency. The framework would be evaluated on complex reasoning tasks, with the goal of achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy compared to static role assignment.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, which involves proposing new hypotheses to improve existing systems. Current multi-agent frameworks use fixed roles, which may not be optimal for all tasks. By introducing dynamic role assignment, we can create a more flexible and adaptive reasoning system. Additionally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is used to design the role assignment mechanism, ensuring that it is both effective and scalable.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that dynamic role assignment can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-agent reasoning. By adapting roles based on task requirements and agent performance, we can achieve better collaboration and faster problem-solving. This would make the framework more versatile and applicable to a wider range of tasks, increasing its potential for recognition at top conferences."
