    "Title": "Human-in-the-Loop Multi-Agent Reasoning: Leveraging Human Feedback for Improved Consensus",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a human-in-the-loop component to the ReConcile framework, where human experts provide feedback on the agents' reasoning process and confidence scores. The human feedback is used to adjust the agents' confidence scores and refine their answers in real-time. The framework also introduces a 'human-weighted consensus' mechanism, where the final answer is determined by a combination of the agents' confidence scores and the human feedback. The human-in-the-loop component ensures that the reasoning process is aligned with human intuition and expertise, leading to more accurate and trustworthy outcomes.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings' (Theory 8) and 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Theory 4) methodologies. The target paper focuses on automated reasoning, but this idea proposes integrating human feedback to address potential anomalies or edge cases where the automated reasoning process may underperform. The rationale is that human intuition and expertise can provide valuable insights that are not captured by automated reasoning alone. This approach aligns with the target paper's goal of improving reasoning through collaboration and consensus, while also addressing the challenge of integrating human feedback into the reasoning process. The human-weighted consensus mechanism ensures that the final answer is both accurate and trustworthy, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current multi-agent reasoning frameworks, including ReConcile, rely solely on automated reasoning, which may not always align with human intuition or expertise. By introducing a human-in-the-loop component, the framework can leverage human feedback to improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of the reasoning process. This approach also addresses the challenge of integrating human feedback into automated reasoning, which is critical for achieving robust and trustworthy outcomes. The potential impact of this idea is significant, as it could lead to a new paradigm in human-in-the-loop reasoning (Theory 10) and improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences."
