    "title": "Same Author or Just Same Topic? Towards Topic-Independent Style Representations",
    "abstract": "Style is an integral component of language. 001 Recent advances in the development of style 002 representations have increasingly used train-003 ing objectives from authorship veri\ufb01cation 004 (AV) : Do two texts have the same author? 005 The assumption underlying the AV training 006 task (same author approximates same writing 007 style) enables self-supervised and, thus, ex-008 tensive training. However, AV usually does 009 not or only on a coarse-grained level control 010 for topic. The resulting representations might 011 therefore also encode topical information in-012 stead of style alone. We introduce a variation 013 of the AV training task that controls for topic 014 using conversation, domain or no topic control 015 as a topic proxy. To evaluate whether trained 016 representations prefer style over topic informa-017 tion, we propose an original variation to the re-018 cent STEL framework. We \ufb01nd that represen-019 tations trained by controlling for conversation 020 are better than representations trained with do-021 main or no topic control at representing style 022 independent from topic. 023"
