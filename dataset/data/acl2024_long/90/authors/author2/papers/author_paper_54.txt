    "title": "Semantic Proto-Roles",
    "abstract": "We present the first large-scale, corpus based verification of Dowty\u2019s seminal theory of proto-roles. Our results demonstrate both the need for and the feasibility of a property-based annotation scheme of semantic relationships, as opposed to the currently dominant notion of categorical roles."
