    "title": "Modeling Co-Evolution of Attributed and Structural Information in Graph Sequence",
    "abstract": "Most graph neural network models learn embeddings of nodes in static attributed graphs for predictive analysis. Recent attempts have been made to learn temporal proximity of the nodes. We find that real dynamic attributed graphs exhibit complex phenomenon of co-evolution between node attributes and graph structure. Learning node embeddings for forecasting change of node attributes and evolution of graph structure over time remains an open problem. In this work, we present a novel framework called CoEvoGNN for modeling dynamic attributed graph sequence. It preserves the impact of earlier graphs on the current graph by embedding generation through the sequence of attributed graphs. It has a temporal self-attention architecture to model long-range dependencies in the evolution. Moreover, CoEvoGNN optimizes model parameters jointly on two dynamic tasks, attribute inference and link prediction over time. So the model can capture the co-evolutionary patterns of attribute change and link formation. This framework can adapt to any graph neural algorithms so we implemented and investigated three methods based on it: CoEvoGCN, CoEvoGAT, and CoEvoSAGE. Experiments demonstrate the framework (and its methods) outperforms strong baseline methods on predicting an entire unseen graph snapshot of personal attributes and interpersonal links in dynamic social graphs and financial graphs."
