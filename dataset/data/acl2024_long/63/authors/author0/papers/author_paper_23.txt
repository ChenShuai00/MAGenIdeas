    "title": "CTGA: Graph-based Biomedical Literature Search",
    "abstract": "Scientists are relying heavily on biomedical literature search (BLS) engines (e.g., PubMed) to acquire knowledge. Existing BLS systems adopt a \u201cC-A\u201d paradigm that is to design query-document similarity measurement based on words/phrases in the unstructured Content and to develop search Algorithms. In this work, we argue that structures should be extracted and utilized to bridge the gap between text content and knowledge-based search. And graph is one of the most effective structured forms of knowledge and more informative than words or phrases. So we carry out a paradigm shift from \u201cC-A\u201d to \u201cCTGA\u201d. Here \u201cT\u201d is for factual tuple of concepts and relations, and \u201cG\u201d is for knowledge graph. Our proposed graph-based BLS system has three parts: (1) it uses neural information extraction models to turn text into tuples; (2) it represents the tuples of a query or a document as a knowledge graph of linked concept nodes; (3) it has an efficient graph-based matching algorithm to return related documents at the level of structured knowledge. Experiments show that in both objective and subjective evaluation, our CTGA performs significantly better than traditional CA-based PubMed."
