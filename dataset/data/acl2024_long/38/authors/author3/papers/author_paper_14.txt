    "abstract": "\n Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools. With the advent of foundation models, artificial intelligence systems have the potential to be equally adept in tool use as humans. This paradigm, which is dubbed as\n tool learning with foundation models\n , combines the strengths of tools and foundation models to achieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving. This paper presents a systematic investigation and comprehensive review of tool learning. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its cognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool learning research and formulate a general framework: starting from understanding the user instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate generalization in tool learning. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further investigation, such as ensuring trustworthy tool use, enabling tool creation with foundation models, and addressing personalization challenges. Overall, we hope this paper could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models.\n"
