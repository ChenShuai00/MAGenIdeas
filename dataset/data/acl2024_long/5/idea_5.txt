    "Title": "Novelty-Optimized Scientific Idea Generation with Anomaly-Driven Hypothesis Refinement",
    "Idea": "This research proposes an enhanced version of SciMON that integrates anomaly-driven hypothesis refinement to generate scientifically novel and technically deep ideas. The framework will use a combination of analogical reasoning, anomaly detection, and interdisciplinary knowledge integration to refine hypotheses iteratively. The system will be evaluated on its ability to generate ideas that are both novel and grounded in scientific literature, with a focus on technical depth and practical applicability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Propose New Hypotheses' and 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings' methodologies. The target paper highlights the need for novelty and technical depth in generated ideas, which can be achieved by leveraging anomalies in scientific literature. By integrating anomaly detection and interdisciplinary knowledge, the proposed framework can generate hypotheses that are not only novel but also technically robust.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper identifies a gap in the technical depth and novelty of ideas generated by existing models. By incorporating anomaly-driven hypothesis refinement, this research addresses this gap and provides a more robust framework for scientific idea generation. The integration of interdisciplinary knowledge ensures that the generated ideas are both novel and technically sound, making them more likely to be impactful in the scientific community.",
