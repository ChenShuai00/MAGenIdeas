    "Title": "Interdisciplinary Knowledge Graphs for Enhanced Scientific Inspiration",
    "Idea": "This research proposes the development of interdisciplinary knowledge graphs that can be used by SciMON to generate more novel and technically deep scientific ideas. The knowledge graphs will integrate information from multiple scientific domains, allowing the model to draw connections between seemingly unrelated fields. The framework will be evaluated on its ability to generate ideas that are both novel and technically sound, with a focus on cross-disciplinary applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' methodology. The target paper emphasizes the importance of grounding ideas in literature, and interdisciplinary knowledge graphs can provide a richer context for idea generation. By integrating knowledge from multiple domains, the proposed framework can generate more innovative and technically robust ideas.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper highlights the need for novelty and technical depth in generated ideas. By leveraging interdisciplinary knowledge graphs, this research addresses this need by providing a more comprehensive context for idea generation. The integration of knowledge from multiple domains ensures that the generated ideas are both novel and technically sound, making them more likely to be impactful in the scientific community.",
