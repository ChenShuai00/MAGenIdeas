    "Title": "Context-Aware Scientific Idea Generation with Multi-Modal Knowledge Integration",
    "Idea": "This research proposes a context-aware version of SciMON that integrates multi-modal knowledge (e.g., text, images, and data) to generate more novel and technically deep scientific ideas. The framework will use a combination of multi-modal knowledge integration and context-aware mechanisms to generate ideas that are both novel and grounded in a rich context. The system will be evaluated on its ability to generate ideas that are both novel and technically sound, with a focus on multi-modal applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' methodology. The target paper highlights the need for novelty and technical depth in generated ideas, which can be achieved by integrating multi-modal knowledge. By incorporating context-aware mechanisms, the proposed framework can generate more relevant and technically robust ideas.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper identifies a gap in the technical depth and novelty of ideas generated by existing models. By incorporating multi-modal knowledge integration, this research addresses this gap and provides a more robust framework for scientific idea generation. The integration of context-aware mechanisms ensures that the generated ideas are both novel and technically sound, making them more likely to be impactful in the scientific community.",
