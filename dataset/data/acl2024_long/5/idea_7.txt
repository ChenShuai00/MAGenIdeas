    "Title": "Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Scientific Idea Generation",
    "Idea": "This research proposes a dynamic retrieval-augmented version of SciMON that continuously updates its knowledge base with the latest scientific literature. The framework will use a combination of retrieval mechanisms and neural language models to generate novel and technically deep ideas. The system will be evaluated on its ability to generate ideas that are both novel and grounded in the latest scientific literature, with a focus on real-time applicability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' methodology. The target paper highlights the need for novelty and technical depth in generated ideas, which can be achieved by continuously updating the knowledge base with the latest scientific literature. By integrating dynamic retrieval mechanisms, the proposed framework can generate more relevant and technically robust ideas.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper identifies a gap in the technical depth and novelty of ideas generated by existing models. By incorporating dynamic retrieval mechanisms, this research addresses this gap and provides a more robust framework for scientific idea generation. The continuous updating of the knowledge base ensures that the generated ideas are both novel and technically sound, making them more likely to be impactful in the scientific community.",
