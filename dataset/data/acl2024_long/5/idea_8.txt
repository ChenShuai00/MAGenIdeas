    "Title": "Paradigm-Shifting Scientific Idea Generation with Conceptual Evolution",
    "Idea": "This research proposes a paradigm-shifting approach to scientific idea generation by leveraging conceptual evolution. The framework will use a combination of anomaly detection, interdisciplinary knowledge integration, and conceptual evolution to generate novel and technically deep ideas. The system will be evaluated on its ability to generate ideas that lead to significant shifts in scientific paradigms, with a focus on long-term impact.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' methodology. The target paper highlights the need for novelty and technical depth in generated ideas, which can be achieved by identifying anomalies and developing new conceptual frameworks. By integrating conceptual evolution, the proposed framework can generate ideas that lead to significant shifts in scientific paradigms.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper identifies a gap in the technical depth and novelty of ideas generated by existing models. By incorporating conceptual evolution, this research addresses this gap and provides a more robust framework for scientific idea generation. The focus on paradigm-shifting ideas ensures that the generated ideas have a long-term impact on the scientific community.",
