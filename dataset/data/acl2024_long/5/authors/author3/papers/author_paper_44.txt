    "title": "Scaling up Analogy with Crowdsourcing and Machine Learning",
    "abstract": ". Despite tremendous advances in computational models of human analogy, a persistent challenge has been scaling up to \ufb01nd useful analogies in large, messy, real-world data. The availability of large idea repositories (e.g., the U.S. patent database) could signi\ufb01cantly accelerate innovation and discovery in a way never previously possible. Previous approaches have been limited by relying on hand-created databases that have high relational structure but are very sparse (e.g., predicate calculus representations). Traditional machine-learning/information-retrieval similarity metrics (e.g., LSA) can scale to large, natural-language datasets; however, while these methods are good at detecting surface similarity, they struggle to account for structural similarity. In this paper, we pro-pose to leverage crowdsourcing techniques to construct a dataset with rich \u201canalogy-tuning\u201d signals, used to guide machine learning models towards matches based on relations rather than surface features. We demonstrate our approach with a crowdsourced analogy identi\ufb01cation task, whose results are used to train deep learning algorithms. Our initial results suggest that a deep learning model trained on positive/negative example analogies from the task can \ufb01nd more analogous matches than an LSA baseline, and that incorporating behavioral signals (such as queries used to retrieve an analogy) can further boost its performance."
