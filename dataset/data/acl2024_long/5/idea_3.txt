    "Title": "Cross-Domain Scientific Idea Generation via Multi-Task Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-task learning approach for generating scientific ideas across multiple domains. The framework leverages shared representations learned from diverse scientific tasks to generate hypotheses that are novel and relevant across different fields. The approach includes a novelty optimization mechanism that ensures the generated ideas are not only novel within their domain but also have potential applications in other fields.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on the 'Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies' methodology, particularly Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory, which emphasizes the importance of identifying common patterns across multiple case studies. The multi-task learning approach aligns with Carnap’s inductive logic, which focuses on constructing conceptual frameworks that can be applied across different domains.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current methods for generating scientific ideas often focus on a single domain, limiting their potential impact. By leveraging multi-task learning, this approach can generate hypotheses that are novel and relevant across multiple fields, increasing their potential for scientific breakthroughs. This approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of cross-domain scientific idea generation and could be a strong contender for best paper awards.",
