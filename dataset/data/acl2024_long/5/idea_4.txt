    "Title": "Interactive Scientific Idea Generation with Human-in-the-Loop Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an interactive framework for generating scientific ideas that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback. The approach involves generating initial hypotheses using a neural language model and then iteratively refining them based on feedback from domain experts. The framework includes a novelty optimization mechanism that ensures the final ideas are both novel and scientifically valid.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is derived from the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' methodology, particularly Laudan’s methodological improvement model, which emphasizes the importance of refining methods based on feedback and performance. The human-in-the-loop approach aligns with Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving, which highlights the role of human intuition and creativity in the scientific process.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current methods for generating scientific ideas often lack the input of domain experts, which can limit their relevance and validity. By incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, this approach can generate hypotheses that are both novel and scientifically sound. This interactive framework has the potential to significantly improve the quality of generated ideas and could be a strong contender for best paper awards.",
