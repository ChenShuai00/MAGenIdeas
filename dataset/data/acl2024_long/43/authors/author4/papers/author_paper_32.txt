    "title": "Context-Aware Graph Segmentation for Graph-Based Translation",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an improved graph-based translation model which segments an input graph into node-induced subgraphs by taking source context into consideration. Translations are generated by combining subgraph translations left-to-right using beam search. Experiments on Chinese\u2013English and German\u2013English demonstrate that the context-aware segmentation significantly improves the baseline graph-based model."
