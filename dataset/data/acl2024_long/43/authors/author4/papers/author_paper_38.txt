    "title": "ProphetMT: controlled language authoring aid system description",
    "abstract": "This paper presents ProphetMT, a monolingual Controlled Language (CL) authoring tool which allows users to easily compose an \nin-domain sentence with the help of tree-based SMT-driven auto-suggestions. The interface also visualizes target-language sentences \nas they are built by the SMT system. When the user is finished composing, the final translation(s) are generated by a tree-based SMT \nsystem using the text and structural information provided by the user. With this domain-specific controlled language, ProphetMT will \nproduce highly reliable translations. The contributions of this work are: 1) we develop a user-friendly auto-completion-based editor \nwhich guarantees that the vocabulary and grammar chosen by a user are compatible with a tree-based SMT model; 2) by applying a \nshift-reduce-like parsing feature, this editor allows users to write from left-to-right and generates the parsing results on the fly. Accordingly, with this in-domain composing restriction as well as the gold-standard parsing result, a highly reliable translation can be generated."
