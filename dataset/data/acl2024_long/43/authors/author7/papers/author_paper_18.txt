    "title": "Retrieval-based Disentanglement with Distant Supervision",
    "abstract": "Disentangled representation learning remains challenging as ground truth factors of variation do not naturally exist. To address this, we present Vocabulary Disentanglement Retrieval (VDR), a simple yet effective retrieval-based disentanglement framework that leverages nature language as distant supervision. Our approach is built upon the widely-used bi-encoder architecture with disentanglement heads and is trained on data-text pairs that are readily available on the web or in existing datasets. This makes our approach task-and modality-agnostic with potential for a wide range of downstream applications. We conduct experiments on 16 datasets in both text-to-text and cross-modal scenarios and evaluate VDR in a zero-shot setting. With the incorporation of disentanglement heads and a minor increase in parameters, VDR achieves signi\ufb01-cant improvements over the base retriever it is built upon, with a 9% higher on NDCG@10 scores in zero-shot text-to-text retrieval and an average of 13% higher recall in cross-modal retrieval. In comparison to other baselines, VDR outperforms them in most tasks, while also improving explainability and ef\ufb01ciency."
