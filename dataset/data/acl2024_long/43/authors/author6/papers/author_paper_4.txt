    "title": "Immune-related gene signature associates with immune landscape and predicts prognosis accurately in patients with skin cutaneous melanoma",
    "abstract": "Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is the skin cancer that causes the highest number of deaths worldwide. There is growing evidence that the tumour immune microenvironment is associated with cancer prognosis, however, there is little research on the role of immune status in melanoma prognosis. In this study, data on patients with Skin cutaneous melanoma were downloaded from the GEO, TCGA, and GTEx databases. Genes associated with the immune pathway were screened from published papers and lncRNAs associated with them were identified. We performed immune microenvironment and functional enrichment analyses. The analysis was followed by applying univariate/multivariate Cox regression algorithms to finally identify three lncRNAs associated with the immune pathway for the construction of prognostic prediction models (CXCL10, RXRG, and SCG2). This stepwise downscaling method, which finally screens out prognostic factors and key genes and then uses them to build a risk model, has excellent predictive power. According to analyses of the model\u2019s reliability, it was able to differentiate the prognostic value and continued existence of Skin cutaneous melanoma patient populations more effectively. This study is an analysis of the immune pathway that leads lncRNAs in Skin cutaneous melanoma in an effort to open up new treatment avenues for Skin cutaneous melanoma."
