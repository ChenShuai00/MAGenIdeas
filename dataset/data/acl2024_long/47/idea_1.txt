    "Title": "Semantic Entropy for Uncertainty Quantification in Open-Ended Language Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a novel method for measuring uncertainty in open-ended language generation tasks by leveraging semantic entropy. Unlike traditional entropy measures that focus on token-level probabilities, semantic entropy captures the variability in meaning across multiple generated outputs. The method involves generating multiple responses to the same prompt, clustering them based on semantic similarity, and computing entropy over the clusters. This approach provides a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty, particularly in tasks like summarization and dialogue generation, where semantic equivalence is common. The framework will be evaluated on benchmarks like CNN/DM and Reddit TL;DR, with a focus on improving the reliability of generated content.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** (abstracting general laws from multiple studies) and **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (explaining and integrating anomalous findings). Traditional uncertainty measures fail to account for semantic equivalence, leading to misleading confidence estimates. By focusing on semantic entropy, we address this gap and provide a more accurate measure of uncertainty. The idea also builds on recent work in semantic similarity and clustering, making it a natural extension of existing research.",
    "Rationale": "Open-ended language generation tasks are inherently uncertain, but current methods for quantifying uncertainty are limited. Semantic entropy provides a more meaningful measure of uncertainty by focusing on the variability in meaning rather than token-level probabilities. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes applications, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at conferences like ICLR or CVPR."
