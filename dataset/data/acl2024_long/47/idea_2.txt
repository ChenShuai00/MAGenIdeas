    "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Trustworthy Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a new framework for fine-tuning LLMs using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that incorporates confidence calibration. The framework extends existing RLHF methods by adding a confidence estimation module, similar to BSDetector, which provides uncertainty estimates for model outputs. These estimates are used to weight the human feedback, ensuring that low-confidence outputs are given less weight during fine-tuning. The framework will be evaluated on tasks like summarization and dialogue generation, with a focus on improving both performance and calibration. The key innovation is the integration of confidence estimation into the RLHF process, making the fine-tuned models more trustworthy and reliable.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (designing and improving existing methods) and **Reichenbach’s confirmation theory** (evaluating and selecting competing theories). Current RLHF methods do not account for uncertainty in model outputs, which can lead to overfitting to noisy or unreliable feedback. By incorporating confidence calibration, we address this limitation and create a more robust fine-tuning process. The idea also builds on the success of BSDetector and recent advances in RLHF, making it a natural extension of existing work.",
    "Rationale": "RLHF is a powerful method for fine-tuning LLMs, but it is often limited by the quality of human feedback. By incorporating confidence calibration, this framework ensures that the fine-tuning process is more robust and reliable, leading to better-calibrated models. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the trustworthiness of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at conferences like NeurIPS or ACL."
