    "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Robust Language Model Outputs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel framework that integrates uncertainty quantification with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The framework leverages BSDetector's confidence estimation to dynamically adjust the reasoning steps in CoT, ensuring that the model only proceeds with high-confidence intermediate reasoning. By combining uncertainty-aware mechanisms with CoT, the framework aims to improve the robustness and reliability of LLM outputs, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where errors in intermediate steps can propagate and lead to incorrect final answers. The framework will be evaluated on benchmarks like GSM8K and CommonsenseQA, with a focus on reducing hallucination and improving factual accuracy.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the scientific discovery theories of **Propose New Hypotheses (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method)** and **Design and Improve Existing Methods (Laudan’s methodological improvement model)**. The hypothesis is that integrating uncertainty quantification with CoT reasoning will lead to more reliable and accurate LLM outputs. The improvement in methodology comes from dynamically adjusting reasoning steps based on confidence scores, which is a novel extension of existing CoT techniques.",
    "Rationale": "Chain-of-thought reasoning has shown promise in improving LLM performance on complex tasks, but it lacks mechanisms to handle uncertainty in intermediate steps. By integrating BSDetector's confidence estimation, this framework addresses a critical gap in CoT reasoning, making it more robust and trustworthy. This idea has the potential to significantly advance the field by providing a principled approach to uncertainty-aware reasoning, which is essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications."
