    "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Optimization for Black-Box Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a method to optimize prompts for black-box LLMs in a way that maximizes the reliability of their outputs by incorporating uncertainty quantification. The method would involve generating multiple prompts for a given task, querying the LLM with each prompt, and selecting the prompt that yields the most confident and consistent responses. This approach would leverage the uncertainty estimates provided by methods like BSDetector to guide prompt optimization, ensuring that the LLM's outputs are not only accurate but also trustworthy. The method could be applied to a wide range of tasks, including question answering, summarization, and code generation, making it highly impactful.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' theory (Laudan’s methodological improvement model, Hacking’s experimental system theory). The target paper introduces BSDetector as a method for uncertainty quantification, but it does not explore how this uncertainty information can be used to improve the inputs (prompts) to the LLM. By optimizing prompts based on uncertainty estimates, we can enhance the reliability of LLM outputs, which is a natural extension of the target paper's contributions.",
    "Rationale": "Prompt engineering is a critical factor in the performance of LLMs, but current methods often rely on trial and error. By incorporating uncertainty quantification into prompt optimization, we can create a more systematic and reliable approach to prompt design. This would not only improve the accuracy of LLM outputs but also make them more trustworthy, which is essential for real-world applications. The method is particularly relevant for black-box LLMs, where users have limited control over the model's internal workings and must rely on external methods to ensure reliability."
