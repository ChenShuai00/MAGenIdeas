    "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency for Reliable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the self-consistency method for chain-of-thought reasoning by incorporating uncertainty quantification. The framework uses BSDetector's confidence scores to weight different reasoning paths, ensuring that high-confidence paths contribute more to the final answer. This approach improves the reliability of self-consistency by reducing the influence of low-confidence or erroneous reasoning paths. The method will be evaluated on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K and StrategyQA, with a focus on improving accuracy and reducing errors in multi-step reasoning tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the scientific discovery theories of **Propose New Hypotheses (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method)** and **Design and Improve Existing Methods (Laudan’s methodological improvement model)**. The hypothesis is that weighting reasoning paths based on confidence scores will lead to more reliable self-consistency, and the improvement in methodology comes from integrating uncertainty quantification into the self-consistency framework.",
    "Rationale": "Self-consistency is a promising technique for improving LLM reasoning, but it treats all reasoning paths equally, regardless of their confidence. By incorporating uncertainty-aware weighting, this idea enhances the reliability of self-consistency, making it more robust and trustworthy. The novelty and practical impact of this approach make it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
