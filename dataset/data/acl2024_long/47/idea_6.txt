    "Title": "Semantic Entropy for Uncertainty Quantification in Natural Language Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a new method for quantifying uncertainty in LLM outputs by measuring semantic entropy. Unlike traditional entropy measures that focus on token-level probabilities, semantic entropy captures the variability in meaning across multiple generated outputs. The method leverages paraphrasing and semantic equivalence to group similar outputs and compute entropy based on their semantic diversity. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like question answering and summarization, where different phrasings can convey the same meaning. The proposed method will be evaluated on datasets like TriviaQA and CNN/DM, with a focus on improving uncertainty calibration and reducing overconfidence in incorrect outputs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the scientific discovery theories of **Define New Scientific Problems (Kuhn’s paradigm theory)** and **Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies (Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory)**. The problem of semantic equivalence in uncertainty quantification is identified as an anomaly in existing methods, and the solution is derived by synthesizing insights from multiple related studies on semantic similarity and entropy.",
    "Rationale": "Current uncertainty quantification methods in LLMs often fail to account for semantic equivalence, leading to overconfidence in incorrect outputs. By introducing semantic entropy, this idea provides a more nuanced and accurate measure of uncertainty, which is critical for improving the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications. The novelty and practical impact of this approach make it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
