    "Title": "Uncertainty-Weighted Ensemble for Black-Box Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an ensemble method for black-box LLMs that weights the outputs of multiple models based on their uncertainty estimates. The ensemble would combine the outputs of several LLMs, each with its own uncertainty quantification method (e.g., BSDetector), and weight the contributions of each model based on how confident it is in its predictions. This approach would improve the overall reliability of the ensemble by giving more weight to models that are more certain about their outputs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies' theory (Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory, Carnap’s inductive logic). The target paper focuses on uncertainty quantification for a single LLM, but by combining multiple models with different uncertainty estimates, we can create a more robust and reliable system. This approach leverages the strengths of multiple models while mitigating their individual weaknesses.",
    "Rationale": "Ensemble methods are a powerful way to improve the performance of machine learning models, but they are rarely used in the context of black-box LLMs. By incorporating uncertainty quantification into the ensemble, we can create a more reliable and trustworthy system that is better suited for real-world applications. This method is particularly relevant for tasks where reliability is critical, such as medical diagnosis or legal advice. The approach is novel and has the potential to significantly improve the performance of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
