    "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Robust Multi-Step Inference in Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel framework that integrates uncertainty quantification with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs. The framework dynamically adjusts the reasoning path based on the uncertainty estimates at each step, ensuring that the model can backtrack or seek alternative paths when confidence is low. This approach combines BSDetector's confidence estimation with CoT prompting, enabling the model to not only generate intermediate reasoning steps but also assess their reliability. The framework will be evaluated on complex reasoning tasks like math word problems and commonsense QA, where multi-step reasoning is critical. The key innovation is the use of uncertainty to guide the reasoning process, making it more robust and interpretable.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (exploring the boundaries of existing methods) and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (proposing a new hypothesis through analogical reasoning). Current CoT methods assume that all reasoning steps are equally reliable, which is often not the case. By integrating uncertainty quantification, we address this limitation and create a more robust reasoning framework. The idea also builds on the success of BSDetector and recent advances in CoT prompting, making it a natural extension of existing work.",
    "Rationale": "Multi-step reasoning is a key strength of LLMs, but it is prone to errors when intermediate steps are incorrect. By incorporating uncertainty estimates, this framework ensures that the model can identify and correct unreliable reasoning paths, leading to more accurate and trustworthy outputs. This approach has the potential to significantly improve performance on complex reasoning tasks, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like NeurIPS or ACL."
