    "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Human-in-the-Loop Systems for LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a human-in-the-loop system for LLMs that uses uncertainty quantification to guide human intervention. The system would flag outputs with high uncertainty for human review, ensuring that unreliable predictions are not used in critical applications. The uncertainty estimates provided by methods like BSDetector would be used to prioritize which outputs should be reviewed by humans, making the system more efficient and effective.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings' theory (Kuhnâ€™s theory of crises and revolutions). The target paper highlights the importance of uncertainty quantification in improving the trustworthiness of LLMs, but it does not explore how this information can be used to guide human intervention. By integrating uncertainty estimates into a human-in-the-loop system, we can create a more robust and reliable workflow for using LLMs in high-stakes applications.",
    "Rationale": "Human-in-the-loop systems are a common way to ensure the reliability of AI systems, but they are often inefficient because they require humans to review a large number of outputs. By using uncertainty quantification to prioritize which outputs should be reviewed, we can make these systems more efficient and effective. This approach is particularly relevant for applications where reliability is critical, such as healthcare or finance. The method is novel and has the potential to significantly improve the trustworthiness of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
