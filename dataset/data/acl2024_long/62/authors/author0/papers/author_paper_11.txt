    "title": "Linear Representation of Numeric Attributes in Language Models",
    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) can express factual 001 knowledge involving numeric attributes such as 002 Karl Popper was born in 1902 . However, if and 003 how such knowledge is encoded in the model\u2019s 004 internal representations is poorly understood. 005 Here, we introduce a simple method for find-006 ing and editing representations of numeric at-007 tributes such as an entity\u2019s birth year. Empiri-008 cally, we find low-dimensional subspaces that 009 encode numeric attributes in an interpretable 010 and easily editable fashion. When editing repre-011 sentations along directions in these subspaces, 012 LM output changes accordingly. For exam-013 ple, by patching activations along a \"birthyear\" 014 direction we can make the LM express an in-015 creasingly late birthyear, e.g., \"Karl Popper was 016 born in 1913\", \"Karl Popper was born in 1944\", 017 \"Karl Popper was born in 1975\". Attribute-018 encoding directions exist across several nu-019 meric properties in all models under consid-020 eration, suggesting the intruiging possibility 021 that linear representations of numeric attributes 022 reliably emerge during LM pretraining. 023"
