    "title": "Relaxed stability conditions for discrete-time fuzzy-model-based control systems",
    "abstract": "This paper presents the stability conditions for discrete-time fuzzy-model-based control systems subject to parameter uncertainties. The nonlinear plant subject to parameter uncertainties is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model with uncertain grades of memberships. Relaxed stability conditions for this class of fuzzy control systems will be derived to guarantee the system stability. A numerical example will be presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
