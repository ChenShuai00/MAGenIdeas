    "title": "KnowComp at SemEval-2024 Task 9: Conceptualization-Augmented Prompting with Large Language Models for Lateral Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Lateral thinking is essential in breaking away from conventional thought patterns and finding innovative solutions to problems. Despite this, language models often struggle with reasoning tasks that require lateral thinking. In this paper, we present our system for SemEval-2024 Task 9\u2019s BrainTeaser challenge, which requires language models to answer brain teaser questions that typically involve lateral reasoning scenarios. Our framework is based on large language models and incorporates a zero-shot prompting method that integrates conceptualizations of automatically detected instances in the question. We also transform the task of question answering into a declarative format to enhance the discriminatory ability of large language models. Our zero-shot evaluation results with ChatGPT indicate that our approach outperforms baselines, including zero-shot and few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning. Additionally, our system ranks ninth on the official leaderboard, demonstrating its strong performance."
