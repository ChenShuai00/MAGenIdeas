    "Title": "Cross-Domain Abstraction: Enhancing LLMs with Multi-Domain Knowledge Integration",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework for cross-domain abstraction that enables LLMs to integrate knowledge from multiple domains to improve their abstraction ability. The framework involves training LLMs on a diverse set of domain-specific tasks and using a plausibility estimator to ensure that the integrated knowledge is consistent and relevant. The framework is evaluated on tasks that require cross-domain reasoning and abstraction.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory and Carnap’s inductive logic, which emphasize the importance of identifying common patterns and constructing conceptual frameworks across multiple studies. By integrating knowledge from multiple domains, we aim to enhance the LLM's ability to abstract across diverse contexts.",
    "Rationale": "Cross-domain abstraction is essential for tasks that require knowledge from multiple fields. A framework that integrates knowledge from diverse domains can significantly improve the LLM's ability to reason and abstract across contexts. This approach is novel and has the potential to revolutionize cross-domain abstraction in LLMs, making it a strong contender for a best paper award.",
