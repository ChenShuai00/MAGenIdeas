    "Title": "Abstraction through Analogical Reasoning: Enhancing LLMs with Cognitive-Inspired Methods",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a cognitive-inspired method that enhances LLM abstraction through analogical reasoning. The method involves training LLMs to recognize and apply analogies between different tasks, improving their ability to abstract underlying principles. A plausibility estimator is used to ensure that the analogies are consistent with the LLM's knowledge. The method is evaluated on tasks that require high levels of abstraction, such as scientific reasoning and complex problem-solving.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method and Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving, which highlight the role of analogical reasoning and creative leaps in hypothesis generation. By incorporating cognitive-inspired methods, we aim to bridge the gap between human and machine abstraction capabilities.",
    "Rationale": "Analogical reasoning is a key component of human abstraction. By integrating this capability into LLMs, we can significantly enhance their ability to understand and apply abstract concepts. This approach is novel and has the potential to revolutionize LLM abstraction, making it a strong contender for a best paper award.",
