    "Title": "Meta-Abstraction: A Meta-Learning Framework for Enhancing Abstraction in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a meta-learning framework that enables LLMs to learn abstraction strategies across multiple tasks and domains. The framework would use a meta-learner to identify common abstraction patterns and transfer these patterns to new tasks, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. The framework would also incorporate a plausibility estimator to ensure that the learned strategies are consistent with the model's existing knowledge. This approach aims to address the limitation of current methods that focus on single-task abstraction and lack generalization.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s paradigm theory and Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory. By identifying common patterns in abstraction tasks across different domains, we can define a new scientific problem: how to generalize abstraction strategies across tasks. The meta-learning framework is a novel hypothesis that leverages analogical reasoning (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method) to transfer knowledge from one task to another. The plausibility estimator is an improvement over existing methods (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) to ensure consistency with the model's knowledge.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs struggle with generalization in abstraction tasks, often performing well on specific tasks but failing to transfer their abstraction skills to new domains. This meta-learning framework addresses this gap by enabling LLMs to learn and transfer abstraction strategies across tasks. The incorporation of a plausibility estimator ensures that the learned strategies are consistent with the model's existing knowledge, improving the reliability of the abstraction process. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance the generalization ability of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
