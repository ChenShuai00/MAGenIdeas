    "Title": "Abstraction via Emergent Properties: Leveraging Emergence for Enhanced LLM Abstraction",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of emergent properties in LLMs to enhance their abstraction ability. The framework involves training LLMs to recognize and leverage emergent properties that arise from complex interactions within the model. A plausibility estimator is used to ensure that the emergent properties are consistent with the LLM's knowledge. The framework is evaluated on tasks that require high levels of abstraction and complex reasoning.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Quine’s holism and Kitcher’s unified theory of science, which emphasize the importance of balancing reductionism and emergence in theoretical models. By leveraging emergent properties, we aim to enhance the LLM's ability to abstract complex concepts and interactions.",
    "Rationale": "Emergent properties are a key aspect of complex systems. By training LLMs to recognize and leverage these properties, we can significantly enhance their ability to abstract complex concepts. This approach is innovative and has the potential to set a new standard for abstraction in LLMs, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
