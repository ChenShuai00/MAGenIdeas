    "Title": "Abstraction through Multi-Modal Instruction Tuning",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of multi-modal data (e.g., text, images, and audio) to enhance the abstraction ability of LLMs. The framework would involve instruction tuning using multi-modal datasets, where the model is trained to abstract concepts from different modalities. The plausibility estimator would be extended to evaluate the consistency of abstracted concepts across modalities. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information provided by different modalities to improve the model's abstraction ability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Quine’s holism, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of knowledge. By integrating multi-modal data, we can construct a more comprehensive theoretical model for abstraction. The use of multi-modal instruction tuning is a novel hypothesis (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method) that leverages the complementary information provided by different modalities. The extended plausibility estimator is an improvement over existing methods (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) to ensure consistency across modalities.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs primarily rely on textual data for abstraction, which limits their ability to abstract concepts from other modalities. By incorporating multi-modal data, this approach can enhance the model's abstraction ability by leveraging the complementary information provided by different modalities. The extended plausibility estimator ensures that the abstracted concepts are consistent across modalities, improving the reliability of the abstraction process. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance the abstraction ability of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
