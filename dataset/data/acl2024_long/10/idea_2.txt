    "Title": "Dynamic Abstraction Networks: A Framework for Real-Time Abstraction in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic abstraction network that allows LLMs to perform real-time abstraction during task execution. The network dynamically adjusts the level of abstraction based on the complexity of the task and the LLM's current understanding. A plausibility estimator is used to ensure that the abstraction levels are appropriate and consistent with the LLM's knowledge. The framework is evaluated on tasks that require real-time decision-making and adaptation.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Lakatos’s research program methodology and Feyerabend’s methodological anarchism, which emphasize the importance of critically analyzing existing methods and exploring their performance under extreme conditions. By developing a dynamic abstraction network, we address the limitations of static abstraction methods and propose a more flexible approach.",
    "Rationale": "Real-time abstraction is crucial for tasks that require quick decision-making and adaptation. A dynamic abstraction network that adjusts based on task complexity and LLM understanding can significantly improve performance in such tasks. This approach is innovative and has the potential to set a new standard for real-time abstraction in LLMs, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
