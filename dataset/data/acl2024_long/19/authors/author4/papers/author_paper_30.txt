    "title": "TransLog: A Unified Transformer-based Framework for Log Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Log anomaly detection is a key component in the field of artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps). Considering log data of variant domains, retraining the whole network for unknown domains is inefficient in real industrial scenarios especially for low-resource domains. However, previous deep models merely focused on extracting the semantics of log sequence in the same domain, leading to poor generalization on multi-domain logs. Therefore, we propose a unified Transformer-based framework for log anomaly detection (\\ourmethod{}), which is comprised of the pretraining and adapter-based tuning stage. Our model is first pretrained on the source domain to obtain shared semantic knowledge of log data. Then, we transfer the pretrained model to the target domain via the adapter-based tuning. The proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets including one source domain and two target domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our simple yet efficient approach, with fewer trainable parameters and lower training costs in the target domain, achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks."
