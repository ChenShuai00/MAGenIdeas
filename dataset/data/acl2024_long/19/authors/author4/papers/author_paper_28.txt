    "title": "3D-QueryIS: A Query-based Framework for 3D Instance Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Previous top-performing methods for 3D instance segmentation often maintain inter-task dependencies and the tendency towards a lack of robustness. Besides, inevitable variations of different datasets make these methods become particularly sensitive to hyper-parameter values and manifest poor generalization capability. In this paper, we address the aforementioned challenges by proposing a novel query-based method, termed as 3D-QueryIS, which is detector-free, semantic segmentation-free, and cluster-free. Specifically, we propose to generate representative points in an implicit manner, and use them together with the initial queries to generate the informative instance queries. Then, the class and binary instance mask predictions can be produced by simply applying MLP layers on top of the instance queries and the extracted point cloud embeddings. Thus, our 3D-QueryIS is free from the accumulated errors caused by the inter-task dependencies. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed 3D-QueryIS method."
