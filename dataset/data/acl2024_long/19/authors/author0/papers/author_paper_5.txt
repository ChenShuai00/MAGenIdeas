    "title": "XFormParser: A Simple and Effective Multimodal Multilingual Semi-structured Form Parser",
    "abstract": "In the domain of document AI, semi-structured form parsing plays a crucial role. This task leverages techniques from key information extraction (KIE), dealing with inputs that range from plain text to intricate modal data comprising images and structural layouts. The advent of pre-trained multimodal models has driven the extraction of key information from form documents in different formats such as PDFs and images. Nonetheless, the endeavor of form parsing is still encumbered by notable challenges like subpar capabilities in multi-lingual parsing and diminished recall in contexts rich in text and visuals. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective \\textbf{M}ultimodal and \\textbf{M}ultilingual semi-structured \\textbf{FORM} \\textbf{PARSER} (\\textbf{XFormParser}), which is anchored on a comprehensive pre-trained language model and innovatively amalgamates semantic entity recognition (SER) and relation extraction (RE) into a unified framework, enhanced by a novel staged warm-up training approach that employs soft labels to significantly refine form parsing accuracy without amplifying inference overhead. Furthermore, we have developed a groundbreaking benchmark dataset, named InDFormBench, catering specifically to the parsing requirements of multilingual forms in various industrial contexts. Through rigorous testing on established multilingual benchmarks and InDFormBench, XFormParser has demonstrated its unparalleled efficacy, notably surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in RE tasks within language-specific setups by achieving an F1 score improvement of up to 1.79\\%. Our framework exhibits exceptionally improved performance across tasks in both multi-language and zero-shot contexts when compared to existing SOTA benchmarks.
