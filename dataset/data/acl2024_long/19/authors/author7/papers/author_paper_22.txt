    "title": "Real-Time Intrusion Detection in Wireless Network: A Deep Learning-Based Intelligent Mechanism",
    "abstract": "With the development of the wireless network techniques, the number of cyber-attack increases significantly, which has seriously threat the security of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). The traditional intrusion detection technology is a prevalent area of study for numerous years, but it may not have a good detection performance in a real-time way. Therefore, it is urgent to design a detection mechanism to detect the attacks timely. In this paper, we exploit a CDBN (Conditional Deep Belief Network)-based intrusion detection mechanism to recognize the attack features and perform the wireless network intrusion detection in real time. To avoid the impact of the imbalanced dataset and the data redundancy on the detection accuracy, a window-based instance selection algorithm \u201cSamSelect\u201d is adopted to undersample the majority class data samples, and a Stacked Contractive Auto-Encoder (SCAE) algorithm is proposed to reduce the dimension of the data samples. By doing so, our proposed mechanism can effectively detect the potential attack and achieve high accuracy. The experiment results show that CDBN can be effectively combined with \u201cSamSelect\u201d and SCAE, and the proposed mechanism has a high detection speed and accuracy, with the average detection time 1.14 ms and the detection accuracy 0.974."
