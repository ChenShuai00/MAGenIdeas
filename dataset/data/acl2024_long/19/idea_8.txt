    "Title": "UniCodeQA: Question Answering for Universal Code Understanding",
    "Idea": "UniCodeQA is a question-answering system designed to help developers understand and debug code generated using universal code. The system allows users to ask natural language questions about the logic, structure, and functionality of the code, providing precise answers based on the universal code representation. The model is trained on a dataset of universal code and corresponding questions, ensuring accurate and context-aware responses.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** and **Sutton’s model of scientific serendipity**. By focusing on the anomalies and unexpected behaviors in generated code, UniCodeQA helps developers identify and resolve issues more efficiently. The serendipitous discovery of patterns in universal code enhances the model's ability to provide insightful answers.",
    "Rationale": "Understanding generated code can be challenging, especially for complex algorithms. UniCodeQA provides a user-friendly interface for developers to interact with the code, reducing the time and effort required for debugging and maintenance. This approach also enhances the transparency and interpretability of code generation models.",
