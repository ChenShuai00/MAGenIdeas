    "title": "Boosting Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models through a New Framework: The Graph of Thought",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large-scale models, such as GPT-4, have showcased remarkable capabilities in addressing standard queries. However, when facing complex problems that require multi-step logical reasoning, their accuracy dramatically decreases. Current research has explored the realm of \\textit{prompting engineering} to bolster the inferential capacities of these models. Our paper unveils a pioneering prompting technique, dubbed \\textit{Graph of Thoughts (GoT)}. Through testing on a trio of escalating challenges: the 24-point game, resolution of high-degree polynomial equations, and derivation of formulas for recursive sequences, our method outperformed GPT-4, achieving accuracy improvements of $89.7\\%$, $86\\%$, and $56\\%$ for each respective task. Moreover, when juxtaposed with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompting method, \\textit{Tree of Thought (ToT)}, our approach registered an average accuracy boost of $23\\%$, $24\\%$, and $15\\%$."
