    "Title": "UniCoder-Verify: Automated Verification of Universal Code for Robust Code Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes integrating an automated verification module into UniCoder to ensure the correctness and robustness of the generated universal code. The verification module would use formal methods and symbolic execution to validate the logical consistency and functional correctness of the universal code before it is translated into the final code. This would reduce errors in the generated code and improve the reliability of the model.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Popper’s falsificationism** and **Mayo’s experimental reasoning theory**. Popper’s emphasis on falsification aligns with the need to rigorously test and verify the universal code to ensure its correctness. Mayo’s experimental reasoning supports the use of formal methods and symbolic execution as critical tools for validating hypotheses. This approach addresses the challenge of ensuring the reliability of generated code, a key concern in code generation tasks.",
    "Rationale": "While UniCoder improves code generation by using universal code as an intermediate representation, there is no mechanism to verify the correctness of the universal code itself. By integrating an automated verification module, the model can catch logical errors early in the process, leading to more robust and reliable code generation. This innovation could make UniCoder more suitable for mission-critical applications where code correctness is paramount.",
