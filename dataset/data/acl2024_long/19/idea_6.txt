    "Title": "UniCode2Text: Bridging the Gap Between Universal Code and Natural Language Documentation",
    "Idea": "This idea focuses on generating natural language documentation directly from universal code, enabling developers to understand the logic and structure of the generated code without needing to read the code itself. UniCode2Text leverages the structured nature of universal code to produce concise and accurate documentation, which can be used for code reviews, debugging, and educational purposes. The model is trained on a dataset of universal code and corresponding natural language descriptions, ensuring high-quality output.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** and **Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory**. By synthesizing the structured information in universal code with natural language, the model creates a bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders. The grounded theory approach ensures that the documentation is derived from real-world examples, enhancing its practicality.",
    "Rationale": "Documentation is a critical but often neglected aspect of software development. By automating the generation of documentation from universal code, UniCode2Text reduces the burden on developers and improves the accessibility of generated code. This approach also enhances the usability of universal code in collaborative and educational settings.",
