    "Title": "UniCoder-Eval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Universal Code-Based Code Generation Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes creating a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance of universal code-based code generation models like UniCoder. The benchmark would include a diverse set of programming tasks, languages, and evaluation metrics to assess the model’s accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. This would provide a standardized framework for comparing different models and identifying areas for improvement.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Carnap’s inductive logic** and **Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory**. Carnap’s logic supports the use of systematic evaluation to validate hypotheses, while grounded theory emphasizes the importance of empirical data in developing new theories. By creating a benchmark, this approach provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and advancing universal code-based models.",
    "Rationale": "There is currently no standardized benchmark for evaluating universal code-based code generation models. By creating such a benchmark, researchers can systematically compare different models and identify best practices. This innovation could accelerate progress in the field of code generation and provide valuable insights for future research.",
