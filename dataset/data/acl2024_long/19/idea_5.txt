    "Title": "UniCode++: Enhancing Code Generation with Dynamic Universal Code Adaptation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic adaptation mechanism for universal code (UniCode) that adjusts the intermediate representation based on the complexity and context of the programming task. Unlike the static UniCode approach, UniCode++ introduces a feedback loop where the model iteratively refines the universal code by analyzing the generated code's correctness and efficiency. This approach leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the universal code structure, ensuring it aligns with the specific requirements of the task. The significance lies in its ability to handle a wider range of programming tasks, from simple scripts to complex algorithms, while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**. The dynamic adaptation mechanism aligns with the need to improve existing methods by integrating feedback loops and optimization techniques. The iterative refinement process mirrors problem-solving strategies, where hypotheses are continuously tested and improved.",
    "Rationale": "Current code generation models often struggle with tasks that require varying levels of abstraction and complexity. By dynamically adapting the universal code, UniCode++ can better capture the nuances of different programming tasks, leading to more accurate and efficient code generation. This approach also addresses the limitations of static intermediate representations, which may not be optimal for all tasks.",
