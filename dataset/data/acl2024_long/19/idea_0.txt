    "Title": "UniCoder++: Enhancing Universal Code Representation with Dynamic Contextual Adaptation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes extending UniCoder by introducing a dynamic contextual adaptation mechanism for universal code representation. The model would dynamically adjust the level of abstraction in the universal code based on the complexity of the task and the target programming language. For example, for simpler tasks or languages with limited expressiveness, the universal code would be more abstract, while for complex tasks or high-level languages, it would include more detailed algorithmic steps. This approach would improve the versatility and accuracy of code generation across diverse programming tasks and languages.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Kitcher’s unified theory of science**. The dynamic contextual adaptation mechanism aligns with Laudan’s emphasis on improving existing methods by integrating new tools and techniques. Kitcher’s unified theory supports the idea of creating a flexible, interdisciplinary framework that adapts to different contexts. This approach addresses the limitations of static universal code representations and enhances the model’s applicability to a wider range of tasks.",
    "Rationale": "Current universal code representations in UniCoder are static, which may not optimally handle tasks of varying complexity or languages with different levels of expressiveness. By introducing dynamic contextual adaptation, the model can better align the universal code with the specific requirements of each task, leading to more accurate and efficient code generation. This innovation could significantly improve the performance of code generation models in real-world applications.",
