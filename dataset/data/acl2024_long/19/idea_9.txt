    "Title": "UniCodeEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Universal Code-Based Code Generation",
    "Idea": "UniCodeEval introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance of code generation models that use universal code as an intermediate representation. The benchmark includes a diverse set of programming tasks, ranging from simple scripts to complex algorithms, and measures the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the generated code. The evaluation framework also includes metrics for assessing the quality of the universal code itself, such as its clarity, consistency, and adaptability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Popper’s falsificationism** and **Mayo’s experimental reasoning theory**. By designing a rigorous evaluation framework, UniCodeEval ensures that the effectiveness of universal code-based models can be objectively tested and validated. The focus on falsification aligns with the need to identify and address the limitations of current approaches.",
    "Rationale": "As universal code gains traction in code generation, there is a need for standardized benchmarks to evaluate its effectiveness. UniCodeEval provides a comprehensive and objective framework for assessing the performance of models, enabling researchers to compare different approaches and identify areas for improvement. This benchmark also promotes transparency and reproducibility in code generation research.",
