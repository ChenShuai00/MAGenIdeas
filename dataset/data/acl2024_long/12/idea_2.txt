    "Title": "ProteinKG: Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Protein Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes ProteinKG, a knowledge graph-enhanced protein language model that integrates protein sequence data with structured knowledge from biological knowledge graphs. ProteinKG is pre-trained on a large corpus of protein sequences and fine-tuned using a dataset of protein-function annotations derived from knowledge graphs. The model leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode knowledge graph information and combines it with sequence embeddings to improve protein function prediction and sequence generation tasks. ProteinKG also introduces a novel attention mechanism that dynamically weights the importance of knowledge graph nodes based on the input protein sequence.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. It addresses the limitation of current protein language models, which often lack access to structured biological knowledge. By integrating knowledge graphs, ProteinKG enhances the model's ability to capture complex relationships between proteins and their functions. The idea aligns with the target paper's focus on aligning human and protein language and leverages the growing trend of knowledge-enhanced language models in AI research.",
    "Rationale": "Protein language models have shown promise in protein function prediction and sequence generation, but their performance is often limited by the lack of structured biological knowledge. ProteinKG addresses this limitation by integrating knowledge graphs, which provide valuable context for understanding protein functions. The dynamic attention mechanism ensures that the model focuses on the most relevant knowledge graph nodes for each input sequence, improving prediction accuracy and interpretability. This idea has the potential to advance protein language modeling and align with the target paper's goal of bridging human and protein language.",
