    "Title": "ProteinGPT: Generative Pre-training for Protein-Language Alignment",
    "Idea": "ProteinGPT proposes a generative pre-training framework specifically designed for protein-language alignment. The framework pre-trains a transformer model on a large corpus of protein sequences and textual descriptions, enabling it to generate accurate and contextually relevant protein function predictions. By leveraging generative pre-training, ProteinGPT improves the alignment between protein and human language, making it a powerful tool for bioinformatics research.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kitcher’s unified theory of science and Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions. The hypothesis is that generative pre-training can be applied to protein-language alignment, leading to a unified and scalable approach. This represents a paradigm shift in how protein-language alignment is approached.",
    "Rationale": "Generative pre-training has been highly successful in natural language processing, but its application to protein-language alignment is underexplored. ProteinGPT addresses this gap by proposing a specialized pre-training framework that improves the alignment between protein and human language, aligning with the target paper’s goals.",
