    "Title": "ProteinKG: A Knowledge Graph-Augmented Protein Language Model for Multimodal Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces ProteinKG, a protein language model that integrates knowledge graphs with multimodal learning to enhance protein representation. ProteinKG combines protein sequences, textual descriptions, and structural data from knowledge graphs into a unified framework. The model uses a graph neural network (GNN) to encode knowledge graph information and a transformer to process protein sequences and text, enabling cross-modal alignment and improved protein function prediction.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Kitcher’s unified theory of science**. The goal is to improve existing methods by integrating diverse data sources and creating a unified framework for protein representation. This aligns with the target paper's emphasis on knowledge graph-based instruction generation and multimodal learning.",
    "Rationale": "Current protein language models often rely on single modalities (e.g., sequences) and lack integration with external knowledge. ProteinKG addresses this by combining knowledge graphs with multimodal learning, leading to more comprehensive and accurate protein representations. This could significantly advance protein function prediction and design.",
