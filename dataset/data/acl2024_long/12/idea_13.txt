    "Title": "ProteinViz: Visual Interpretability for Protein-Language Models",
    "Idea": "ProteinViz introduces a visual interpretability framework for protein-language models, enabling researchers to visualize and understand the decision-making process of these models. The framework integrates protein sequences, structural data, and textual annotations into a unified visualization tool, providing insights into how the model generates predictions. By enhancing interpretability, ProteinViz makes protein-language models more accessible and useful for researchers.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Kuhn’s paradigm theory and Laudan’s methodological improvement model. The anomaly addressed is the lack of interpretability in protein-language models. By proposing a visual interpretability framework, ProteinViz enhances the usability of these models, aligning with the target paper’s focus on interpretability.",
    "Rationale": "Interpretability is a critical factor in the adoption of machine learning models in bioinformatics. ProteinViz addresses this need by providing a visual framework that helps researchers understand the decision-making process of protein-language models, making them more accessible and useful.",
