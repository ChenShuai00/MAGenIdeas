    "Title": "BioInstruct: Zero-Shot Protein Design via Instruction-Tuned Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces BioInstruct, a zero-shot protein design framework that leverages instruction-tuned language models to generate novel protein sequences based on natural language descriptions of desired functions. BioInstruct is pre-trained on a large corpus of protein sequences and biomedical texts, and fine-tuned using a dataset of protein-function instructions. The framework enables users to input free-text descriptions of protein functions (e.g., 'design a protein that binds to glucose') and generates corresponding protein sequences without the need for task-specific training data. BioInstruct also incorporates a knowledge graph-based validation module to ensure the biological plausibility of generated sequences.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. It extends the concept of instruction tuning, which has been successful in NLP, to the domain of protein design. By enabling zero-shot protein design, BioInstruct addresses the challenge of designing proteins for novel functions without extensive experimental data. The idea aligns with the target paper's focus on aligning human and protein language and leverages the growing trend of instruction-tuned models in AI research.",
    "Rationale": "Protein design is a critical area of research with applications in drug discovery, synthetic biology, and biotechnology. However, current methods often require extensive experimental data and are limited to specific tasks. BioInstruct overcomes these limitations by enabling zero-shot protein design based on natural language descriptions, making it accessible to a broader range of users. The integration of knowledge graphs ensures the biological plausibility of generated sequences, enhancing the framework's practical utility. This idea has the potential to revolutionize protein design and align with the target paper's goal of bridging human and protein language.",
