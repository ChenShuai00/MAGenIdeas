    "title": "InstructBioMol: Advancing Biomolecule Understanding and Design Following Human Instructions",
    "abstract": "Understanding and designing biomolecules, such as proteins and small molecules, is central to advancing drug discovery, synthetic biology, and enzyme engineering. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have revolutionized biomolecular research, achieving remarkable accuracy in biomolecular prediction and design. However, a critical gap remains between AI's computational power and researchers' intuition, using natural language to align molecular complexity with human intentions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential to interpret human intentions, yet their application to biomolecular research remains nascent due to challenges including specialized knowledge requirements, multimodal data integration, and semantic alignment between natural language and biomolecules. To address these limitations, we present InstructBioMol, a novel LLM designed to bridge natural language and biomolecules through a comprehensive any-to-any alignment of natural language, molecules, and proteins. This model can integrate multimodal biomolecules as input, and enable researchers to articulate design goals in natural language, providing biomolecular outputs that meet precise biological needs. Experimental results demonstrate InstructBioMol can understand and design biomolecules following human instructions. Notably, it can generate drug molecules with a 10% improvement in binding affinity and design enzymes that achieve an ESP Score of 70.4, making it the only method to surpass the enzyme-substrate interaction threshold of 60.0 recommended by the ESP developer. This highlights its potential to transform real-world biomolecular research."
