    "abstract": "Abstract Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have furthered the simultaneous classification of thousands of cells in a single assay based on transcriptome profiling. In most analysis protocols, single-cell type annotation relies on marker genes or RNA-seq profiles, resulting in poor extrapolation. Still, the accurate cell-type annotation for single-cell transcriptomic data remains a great challenge. Here, we introduce scDeepSort (https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scDeepSort), a pre-trained cell-type annotation tool for single-cell transcriptomics that uses a deep learning model with a weighted graph neural network (GNN). Using human and mouse scRNA-seq data resources, we demonstrate the high performance and robustness of scDeepSort in labeling 764 741 cells involving 56 human and 32 mouse tissues. Significantly, scDeepSort outperformed other known methods in annotating 76 external test datasets, reaching an 83.79% accuracy across 265 489 cells in humans and mice. Moreover, we demonstrate the universality of scDeepSort using more challenging datasets and using references from different scRNA-seq technology. Above all, scDeepSort is the first attempt to annotate cell types of scRNA-seq data with a pre-trained GNN model, which can realize the accurate cell-type annotation without additional references, i.e. markers or RNA-seq profiles."
