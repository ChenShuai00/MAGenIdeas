    "Title": "ProteinKG: Knowledge Graph Embedding for Protein-Language Alignment",
    "Idea": "ProteinKG proposes a novel knowledge graph embedding method specifically designed for protein-language alignment. The framework integrates protein sequences, functional annotations, and textual descriptions into a unified knowledge graph, enabling bidirectional generation between protein and human language. By leveraging advanced graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer models, ProteinKG captures complex relationships between proteins and their functions, improving the accuracy and scalability of protein-language alignment tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Laudan’s methodological improvement model and Kitcher’s unified theory of science. The target paper’s knowledge graph-based instruction generation framework is enhanced by introducing a specialized embedding method that captures the intricate relationships between proteins and their functions, leading to a more unified and scalable approach.",
    "Rationale": "Knowledge graphs are powerful tools for representing complex relationships, but existing methods are not optimized for protein-language alignment. ProteinKG addresses this gap by providing a specialized embedding method that improves the accuracy and scalability of bidirectional generation tasks, aligning with the target paper’s goals.",
