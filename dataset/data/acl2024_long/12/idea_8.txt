    "Title": "ProteinShift: A Paradigm Shift in Protein Language Models via Multimodal Pretraining",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes ProteinShift, a paradigm shift in protein language models through multimodal pretraining. ProteinShift integrates protein sequences, textual descriptions, and structural data into a single pretraining framework, enabling the model to learn richer and more generalizable representations. The model uses a transformer architecture with cross-modal attention to align different modalities, leading to improved performance on downstream tasks such as protein function prediction and sequence design.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions** and **Hall’s dynamic system theory**. The goal is to create a paradigm shift in protein language modeling by integrating multimodal data and enabling cross-modal learning. This aligns with the target paper's focus on bridging the gap between protein and human language understanding.",
    "Rationale": "Current protein language models are limited by their reliance on single modalities and lack of cross-modal alignment. ProteinShift addresses this by integrating multimodal data into a unified pretraining framework, leading to more generalizable and accurate protein representations. This could revolutionize protein biology and drug discovery.",
