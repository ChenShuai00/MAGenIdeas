    "Title": "AnomalyProtein: Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Protein Functions",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes AnomalyProtein, a framework for explaining and integrating anomalous protein functions into protein language models. AnomalyProtein uses a combination of auxiliary hypotheses and new explanatory frameworks to model protein functions that deviate from known patterns. The framework leverages knowledge graphs and multimodal data to identify and explain anomalies, enabling more robust and generalizable protein function prediction.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** and **Kuhn’s theory of crises and revolutions**. The hypothesis is that integrating anomalous findings can lead to paradigm shifts in protein function prediction. This aligns with the target paper's focus on causal modeling and knowledge graph-based instruction generation.",
    "Rationale": "Anomalous protein functions are often overlooked or mispredicted by current models. AnomalyProtein addresses this by explicitly modeling and explaining anomalies, leading to more robust and generalizable predictions. This could open new research directions in protein biology and drug discovery.",
