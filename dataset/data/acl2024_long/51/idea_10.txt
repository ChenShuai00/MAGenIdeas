    "Title": "Adaptive Safety-Aware Decoding with Dynamic Token Probability Modulation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an advanced version of SafeDecoding that dynamically modulates token probabilities based on real-time context and adversarial intent detection. The system would integrate a lightweight adversarial detection module that analyzes input prompts for potential jailbreak attempts. If a jailbreak attempt is detected, the system would dynamically adjust the token probabilities to amplify safety disclaimers and suppress harmful content. The modulation would be context-aware, ensuring that the model remains helpful for benign queries while being robust against adversarial attacks. This approach leverages the strengths of SafeDecoding while addressing its limitations in handling sophisticated and adaptive jailbreak attacks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Ziemann’s creative extension theory**, which emphasize the importance of improving existing methods and integrating new technologies. The dynamic modulation of token probabilities is a creative extension of SafeDecoding, enhancing its robustness against adaptive attacks. Additionally, the integration of a real-time adversarial detection module aligns with **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, as it identifies anomalies in current defense strategies and proposes a new approach to LLM safety.",
    "Rationale": "Current defense mechanisms like SafeDecoding are effective but may struggle against adaptive and sophisticated jailbreak attacks. By dynamically modulating token probabilities and integrating real-time adversarial detection, this approach provides a more robust and context-aware defense. This idea is significant because it addresses a critical gap in LLM safety and has the potential to significantly reduce the success rate of jailbreak attacks without compromising the model's helpfulness.",
