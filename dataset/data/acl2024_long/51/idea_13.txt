    "Title": "Explainable Jailbreak Detection: Interpretable Models for Adversarial Prompt Identification",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes the development of explainable machine learning models for detecting jailbreak attempts in LLMs. The models would be designed to provide interpretable explanations for why a particular prompt is flagged as adversarial, allowing developers and users to understand the reasoning behind the detection. The system would use a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches to identify patterns in adversarial prompts, such as semantic inconsistencies, syntactic anomalies, or intent-based red flags. The explainable nature of the models would also facilitate continuous improvement by allowing developers to refine the detection rules based on the explanations provided.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** and **Carnap’s inductive logic**, which emphasize the importance of identifying common patterns and constructing conceptual frameworks. The explainable nature of the models aligns with these theories, as it provides a clear and interpretable framework for understanding adversarial prompts. Additionally, the combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches reflects **Feyerabend’s methodological anarchism**, which advocates for the use of diverse methodologies in scientific discovery.",
    "Rationale": "Current jailbreak detection systems often operate as black boxes, making it difficult for developers to understand why a particular prompt is flagged as adversarial. By developing explainable models, this approach provides greater transparency and facilitates continuous improvement. This idea is significant because it addresses a critical gap in LLM safety and has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of jailbreak detection systems.",
