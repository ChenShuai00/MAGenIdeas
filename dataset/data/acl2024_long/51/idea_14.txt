    "Title": "Cross-Modal Jailbreak Defense: Leveraging Multimodal Data for Enhanced LLM Safety",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a cross-modal defense mechanism that leverages multimodal data (e.g., text, images, audio) to enhance the safety of LLMs. The system would analyze not only the text input but also any associated images or audio to detect potential jailbreak attempts. For example, if a user submits a text prompt along with an image that contains adversarial content, the system would flag the input as potentially harmful. The cross-modal analysis would provide a more comprehensive defense against jailbreak attacks, as it would be able to detect adversarial content that spans multiple modalities.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** and **Lakoff’s conceptual metaphor theory**, which emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary and cross-modal approaches to problem-solving. The cross-modal defense mechanism is a novel application of these theories, as it leverages multiple modalities to enhance LLM safety. The integration of multimodal data also aligns with **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, as it introduces a new approach to detecting adversarial content.",
    "Rationale": "Current jailbreak defense mechanisms focus primarily on text-based inputs, leaving LLMs vulnerable to attacks that leverage other modalities. By incorporating cross-modal analysis, this approach provides a more comprehensive defense against jailbreak attacks. This idea is significant because it addresses a critical gap in LLM safety and has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of defense mechanisms.",
