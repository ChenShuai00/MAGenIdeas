    "Title": "Self-Defending LLMs: Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning for Autonomous Jailbreak Detection",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a self-defending LLM framework that leverages self-supervised learning to autonomously detect and mitigate jailbreak attacks. The model would be trained to generate its own adversarial examples and use them to improve its defense mechanisms. The self-supervised learning process would involve creating a feedback loop where the model continuously generates and evaluates potential jailbreak attempts, refining its detection capabilities over time. The approach would be evaluated on a diverse set of jailbreak attacks and benchmark datasets, with the goal of creating a model that can autonomously defend itself against new and evolving threats.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method) and 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions). Current defense mechanisms rely on external supervision and predefined rules, which may not be sufficient to counter novel jailbreak techniques. By leveraging self-supervised learning, the model can autonomously improve its defense mechanisms, making it more robust against new threats. This approach represents a paradigm shift in how we approach LLM safety, moving from externally supervised to autonomously self-defending models.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale behind this idea is that jailbreak attacks are constantly evolving, and externally supervised defense mechanisms may not be able to keep up with new threats. By leveraging self-supervised learning, the model can continuously improve its defense mechanisms without the need for external supervision. This approach also allows the model to generate its own adversarial examples, which can be used to train and refine its detection capabilities. The use of self-supervised learning represents a significant advancement in LLM safety and has the potential to create models that can autonomously defend themselves against new and evolving threats.",
