    "Title": "Self-Defending LLMs: Autonomous Detection and Mitigation of Jailbreak Attacks",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a self-defending mechanism where LLMs autonomously detect and mitigate jailbreak attacks without external intervention. The approach involves training the LLM to self-evaluate its responses using a built-in safety module that identifies potential jailbreak patterns. If a jailbreak is detected, the model automatically adjusts its decoding strategy to prioritize safety disclaimers. This idea builds on the concept of LLM Self Defense but extends it by integrating the defense mechanism directly into the model's architecture.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theory of 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method) and 'Exploring the Limitations and Shortcomings of Current Methods' (Popper’s falsificationism). The hypothesis is that LLMs can be trained to autonomously defend against jailbreak attacks, addressing the limitations of external defense mechanisms that require additional computational overhead.",
    "Rationale": "Existing jailbreak defenses often rely on external modules or preprocessing steps, which can introduce latency and complexity. By embedding the defense mechanism directly into the LLM, this idea offers a more efficient and scalable solution. The potential impact is significant, as it aligns with the trend of making LLMs more autonomous and robust.",
