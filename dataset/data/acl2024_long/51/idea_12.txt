    "Title": "Reward-Based Reinforcement Learning for Jailbreak-Resistant LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework where LLMs are trained to prioritize safety over helpfulness when faced with potential jailbreak attacks. The RL agent would receive rewards for generating safe responses and penalties for generating harmful content. The reward function would be designed to dynamically adjust based on the context of the query, ensuring that the model remains helpful for benign queries while being highly resistant to adversarial attacks. The framework would also include a safety critic module that evaluates the safety of generated responses and provides feedback to the RL agent.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which emphasize the importance of iterative improvement and problem-solving in scientific discovery. The RL framework is a novel application of these theories, as it uses iterative feedback to improve the model's safety. The dynamic reward function also aligns with **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, as it introduces a new approach to balancing safety and helpfulness in LLMs.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs are often trained to prioritize helpfulness, which can make them vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. By using a reward-based RL framework, this approach ensures that the model prioritizes safety when necessary, without compromising its ability to generate helpful responses for benign queries. This idea is significant because it introduces a new training paradigm that could significantly enhance the safety of LLMs.",
