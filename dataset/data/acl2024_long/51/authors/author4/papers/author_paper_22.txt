    "title": "The First Workshop on Commonsense Representation and Reasoning May 27 , 2022",
    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are often used to store common sense information that is useful for various tasks. However, the extraction of contextuallyrelevant knowledge is an unsolved problem, and current approaches are relatively simple. Here we introduce a triple selection method based on a ranking model and find that it improves question answering accuracy over existing methods. We additionally investigate methods to ensure that extracted triples form a connected graph. Graph connectivity is important for model interpretability, as paths are frequently used as explanations for the reasoning that connects question and answer."
