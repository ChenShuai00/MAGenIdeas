    "title": "Necessary and Suf\ufb01cient Conditions for Satisfying Linear Temporal Logic Constraints using Control Barrier Certi\ufb01cates",
    "abstract": "\u2014Temporal logic speci\ufb01cations have been used to express complex tasks for control systems. Discretization-free approaches, which do not require discretizing the state and input spaces of the system, have been proposed for control synthesis under temporal logic speci\ufb01cations. Among these approaches, control barrier certi\ufb01cate (CBC)-based solutions have attracted increasing attention. The existing CBC-based approaches, however, have no guarantee on always \ufb01nding control laws to satisfy the speci\ufb01cation, and hence are sound but not complete. In this paper, we derive the necessary and suf\ufb01cient conditions for a control law to satisfy a temporal logic speci\ufb01cation over \ufb01nite traces using CBCs. By leveraging the equivalence between satisfying the speci\ufb01cation and violating the negated speci\ufb01cation, we \ufb01rst negate the speci\ufb01cation and construct the deterministic \ufb01nite automaton (DFA) as a representation. We then decompose the DFA into a set of safety problems, where each decomposed problem corresponds to a transition in the DFA. We derive the necessary and suf\ufb01cient conditions for a control law to solve each safety problem via CBC-based approach. We further develop the necessary and suf\ufb01cient conditions to verify whether the control laws associated with different safety problems are composable or not. The composability captures whether a sequence of transitions in the DFA can be realized by the system or not. If the set of composable control laws does not render an accepting run on the DFA, then the system can satisfy the speci\ufb01cation. We illustrate the proposed approach using a numerical case study on a multi-agent system."
