    "title": "Abstraction-Free Control Synthesis to Satisfy Temporal Logic Constraints under Sensor Faults and Attacks",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of synthesizing a controller to satisfy a complex task in the presence of sensor faults and attacks. We model the task using Gaussian distribution temporal logic (GDTL), and propose a solution approach that does not rely on computing any finite abstraction to model the system. We decompose the GDTL specification into a sequence of reach-avoid sub-tasks. We develop a class of fault-tolerant finite time convergence control barrier functions (CBFs) to guarantee that a dynamical system reaches a set within finite time almost surely in the presence of malicious attacks. We use the fault-tolerant finite time convergence CBFs to guarantee the satisfaction of \u2018reach\u2019 property. We ensure \u2018avoid\u2019 part in each sub-task using fault-tolerant zeroing CBFs. These fault-tolerant CBFs formulate a set of linear constraints on the control input for each sub-task. We prove that if the error incurred by system state estimation is bounded by a certain threshold, then our synthesized controller fulfills each reach-avoid sub-task almost surely for any possible sensor fault and attack, and thus the GDTL specification is satisfied with probability one. We demonstrate our proposed approach using a numerical study on the coordination of two wheeled mobile robots."
