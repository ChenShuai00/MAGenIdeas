    "title": "Multipath flow allocation in anonymous wireless networks with dependent sources",
    "abstract": "Protecting the identities of source-destination pairs against eavesdroppers is essential in anonymous wireless networks. In this paper, we consider multipath wireless networks with a pre-defined subset of covert relays and study the problem of flow allocation between correlated source-destination pairs to maximize anonymity under given packet-loss constraints. By formulating the problem within a ratedistortion framework, we derive optimal flow allocations that maximize anonymity based on the side information available to each source. Our results are demonstrated through simulation study."
