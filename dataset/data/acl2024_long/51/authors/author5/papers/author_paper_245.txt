    "title": "A Framework for Securing Future e-Enabled Aircraft Navigation and Surveillance",
    "abstract": "Current air traffic management systems suffer from poor radar coverage and a highly centralized architecture which can under heavy traffic loads overwhelm Air Traffic Control (ATC) centers. Such limitations can lead to inefficient use of the available airspace capacity and insecure scenarios such as low-visibility landings. Future air transportation systems with e-enabled aircraft and networked technologies, such as Automated Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), are cyber-physical systems that promise to help reduce traffic congestion and ATC inefficiencies by enabling exchange of precise surveillance data in shared airspace. This paper focuses on cyber security concerns with highly accurate surveillance of aircraft navigating in a future shared space. A framework is proposed to protect traffic data for both ground and airborne surveillance of aircraft. The framework identifies major threats and vulnerabilities from cyber exploits, specifies security requirements and mitigation solutions. Major security challenges anticipated in supporting networked infrastructure are given along with some open problems."
