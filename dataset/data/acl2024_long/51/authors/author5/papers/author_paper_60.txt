    "title": "Design of Cost-effective Wearable Sensors with integrated Health Monitoring System",
    "abstract": "The present struggle with COVID 19 pandemic has necessitated strategic response in healthcare systems to decrease mortalities even with poor lab infrastructure. With improved disease surveillance, any country can handle health emergencies in a better manner. Combining wearable device technology with smartphone, self-testing can be improved and real time monitoring of various parameters such as temperature, oxygen levels and pulse rate reducing burden on healthcare and creating a vigilant environment. This also help us in contract tracing and also reduce death out of comorbities which has caused a heavy death toll out of pandemic. Here, the components of daily use are deployed with slight modification for creating real time monitoring along with auto alarm and warning transmission to local health ministry. Data collected from sensors are stored in Arduino memory and transmitted to smartphone through Wi-Fi module. Our proposed system is used to process, analyse and display patient's collected data with auto alarm. Our proposed system has been very reliable with average delay of 14s and low power consumption with standing time of nearly 4 hr."
