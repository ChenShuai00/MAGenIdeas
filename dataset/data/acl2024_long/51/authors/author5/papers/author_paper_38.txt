    "title": "Identity-Based Authentication for On-Demand Charging of Electric Vehicles",
    "abstract": "Dynamic wireless power transfer provides means for charging Electric Vehicles (EVs) while driving, avoiding stopping for charging and hence fostering their widespread adoption. Researchers devoted much effort over the last decade to provide a reliable infrastructure for potential users to improve comfort and time management. Due to the severe security and performance system requirements, the different scheme proposed in last years lack of a unified protocol involving the modern architecture model with merged authentication and billing processes. Furthermore, they require the continuous interaction of the trusted entity during the process, increasing the delay for the communication and reducing security due to the large number of message exchanges. In this paper, we propose a secure, computationally lightweight, unified protocol for fast authentication and billing that provides on-demand dynamic charging to comprehensively deal with all the computational and security constraints. The protocol employs an ID-based public encryption scheme to manage mutual authentication and pseudonyms to preserve the user's identity across multiple charging processes. Compared to state-of-the-art authentication protocols, our proposal overcomes the problem of overwhelming interactions and provides public scheme security against the use of simple operations in wide open communications without impacting on performance."
