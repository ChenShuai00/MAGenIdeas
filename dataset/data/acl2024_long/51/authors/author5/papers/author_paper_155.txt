    "title": "Outsourcing Graph Databases with Label-Constrain Query Veri\ufb01cation",
    "abstract": "Graph databases have received a lot of attention due to the easy representation of complex and large data such as web, XML and social network data. In this paper, we consider a three party model where a data owner outsources a graph database to a server in the cloud and allows a set of clients to make queries on the graph database. To assure the correctness of a query answer, the veri\ufb01cation of the query answer is crucial. We present a framework for ensuring the integrity of graph databases and label-constrained graph queries. We \ufb01rst provide a construction of an authenticated data structure for graph databases. Our construction exploits the topology of the graph database to build the authentication tree. Then, we show how to construct the proof for the veri-\ufb01cation of answers of node and edge queries, label-constrain reachability query and pattern matching queries with data retrieval. The proof size of a query answer is proportional to the size of the answer. For the security purpose, the proposed scheme incurs O ( M ) extra storage in the cloud where M is the number of nodes in the graph database. Our scheme is secure against a computationally bounded adversary. Finally, we implement the proposed scheme in C using the PBC library to demonstrate its e\ufb03ciency."
