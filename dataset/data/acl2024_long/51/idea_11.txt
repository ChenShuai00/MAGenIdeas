    "Title": "Multi-Agent Defense Framework for LLMs: Collaborative Adversarial Detection and Mitigation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-agent framework where multiple LLMs collaboratively detect and mitigate jailbreak attacks. Each agent specializes in a specific type of adversarial detection (e.g., semantic anomalies, syntactic anomalies, or intent-based anomalies). When a query is received, the agents analyze it independently and then share their findings to reach a consensus on whether the query is adversarial. If a jailbreak attempt is detected, the agents collectively decide on the best mitigation strategy, such as rephrasing the query, injecting safety disclaimers, or blocking the response. This collaborative approach leverages the strengths of multiple agents to provide a more comprehensive defense against jailbreak attacks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Carnap’s inductive logic** and **Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory**, which emphasize the importance of comparative analysis and identifying common patterns across multiple studies. The multi-agent framework is a novel application of these theories, as it leverages the collective intelligence of multiple agents to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks. The collaborative nature of this approach also aligns with **Kitcher’s unified theory of science**, which advocates for interdisciplinary and collaborative problem-solving.",
    "Rationale": "Single-agent defense mechanisms may struggle to detect sophisticated jailbreak attacks that exploit multiple vulnerabilities. By leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple agents, this framework provides a more robust and comprehensive defense. This idea is significant because it introduces a new paradigm in LLM safety, where collaboration and specialization are key to mitigating adversarial attacks.",
