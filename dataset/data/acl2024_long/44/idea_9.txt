    "Title": "Multi-Modal Watermarking for Code Generation: Combining Text and Visual Watermarks",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-modal watermarking technique for code generation, where both text-based and visual watermarks are embedded in the generated code. The text-based watermark is embedded in the code itself, while the visual watermark is embedded in the code's visual representation, such as syntax highlighting or code formatting. The detection process involves analyzing both the text and visual representations of the code to identify the presence of the watermark. This approach ensures that the watermark remains detectable even if one modality is compromised, providing an additional layer of security for machine-generated code.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Define New Scientific Problems' theory (Kuhn’s paradigm theory) and 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' theory (Quine’s holism). The anomaly identified in the target paper is the low entropy in code generation, which makes traditional text-based watermarking methods less effective. By exploring the visual representation of code, we can discover new problems and build a more robust theoretical model for watermarking. The integration of text-based and visual watermarks is a novel interdisciplinary approach that could lead to a paradigm shift in the field.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that traditional text-based watermarking methods are limited by the low entropy of code, making them less effective. By combining text-based and visual watermarks, we can create a more robust watermarking technique that is less vulnerable to attacks. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the security of machine-generated code, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences. The idea is novel and addresses a fundamental challenge in the field, making it highly impactful.",
