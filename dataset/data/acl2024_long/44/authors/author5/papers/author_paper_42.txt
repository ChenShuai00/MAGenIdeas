    "abstract": "In the work of [2], Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB) consists of 5994 \u201dtrain\u201d images and 5794 \u201dtest\u201d images for 200 classes and they are used as the train-weaksup and test set respectively. The train-fullsup has been additionally collected from Flickr with extra annotated bounding boxes and used as the validation set. Similarly, 1.2M \u201ctrain\u201d images and 10K \u201cvalidation\u201d images for 1000 classes in ImageNet are used as the train-weaksup and test set respectively. Images with annotated bounding boxes from the ImageNetV2 [4] are used as the train-fullsup set. In both datasets, we select the best percentile for IVR from the train-fullsup set both in CUB and ImageNet. Additionally, we use OpenImages [3] which is reorganized in [5] with 29819, 2500, and 5000 images of train-weaksup, train-fullsup and test. Even though the evaluation metric in OpenImages is different from that of CUB and ImageNet, we still use train-fullsup as a validation set to find the optimal percentile for IVR."
