    "abstract": "Table A shows the effectiveness of 1) usage of VPoser [6] and 2) weight of L2 regularizer during the training of the annotation network f . The combination of VPoser and L2 regularizer is the third recipe, introduced in Section 2.2 of the main manuscript. Regardless of the usage of VPoser, setting the non-zero weight of the L2 regularizer produces lower 3D errors of g. This indicates that despite its simplicity, the L2 regularizer helps to prevent anatomically implausible 3D meshes and produce beneficial 3D pseudoGTs. In addition, using VPoser achieves lower 3D errors of g compared to not using it. This is also because VPoser can effectively limit the 3D mesh to anatomically plausible space. Training sets of all annotation networks f in the table are H36M+MI+MSCOCO+3DPW. The ResNet backbone [1] of all annotation networks in the table are initialized with ResNet, pre-trianed on ImageNet [7] classification dataset. Fig. A shows the effectiveness of 1) using VPoser and 2) applying L2 regularizer. Without VPoser and L2 regularizer, the 3D pseudo-GT has an anatomically implausible 3D mesh although its 2D pose is fit to the image. Using VPoser makes the 3D pseudo-GT anatomically plausible; however, it still produces the wrong 3D mesh. The right leg is too much bent to the left side. Finally, using both VPoser and L2 regularizer makes the 3D pseudo-GT anatomically plausible and correct. In particular, additionally using the L2 regularizer enforces the 3D mesh in the latent space of VPoser."
