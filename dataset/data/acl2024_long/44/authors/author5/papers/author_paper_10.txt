    "title": "Neural Relation Graph for Identifying Problematic Data",
    "abstract": "Diagnosing and cleaning datasets are crucial for building robust machine learning systems. However, identifying problems within large-scale datasets with real-world distributions is dif\ufb01cult due to the presence of complex issues, such as label errors or under-representation of certain types. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for identifying problematic data by utilizing a largely ignored source of information: a relational structure of data in the feature-embedded space. We develop an ef\ufb01cient algorithm for detecting label errors and outlier data points based on the relational graph structure of the dataset. We further introduce a visualization tool for contextualizing data points, which can serve as an effective tool for interactively diagnosing datasets. We evaluate label error and out-of-distribution detection performances on large-scale image and language domain tasks, including ImageNet and GLUE benchmarks, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for debugging datasets and building robust machine learning systems."
