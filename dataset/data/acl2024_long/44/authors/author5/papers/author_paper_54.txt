    "title": "Neural Approximation of an Auto-Regressive Process through Confidence Guided Sampling",
    "abstract": "We propose a generic confidence-based approximation that can be plugged in and simplify the auto-regressive generation process with a proved convergence. We first assume that the priors of future samples can be generated in an independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) manner using an efficient predictor. Given the past samples and future priors, the mother AR model can post-process the priors while the accompanied confidence predictor decides whether the current sample needs a resampling or not. Thanks to the i.i.d. assumption, the post-processing can update each sample in a parallel way, which remarkably accelerates the mother model. Our experiments on different data domains including sequences and images show that the proposed method can successfully capture the complex structures of the data and generate the meaningful future samples with lower computational cost while preserving the sequential relationship of the data."
