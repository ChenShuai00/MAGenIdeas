    "title": "Match me if you can: Semantic Correspondence Learning with Unpaired Images",
    "abstract": "Recent approaches for semantic correspondence have focused on obtaining high-quality correspondences using a complicated network, refining the ambiguous or noisy matching points. Despite their performance improvements, they remain constrained by the limited training pairs due to costly point-level annotations. This paper proposes a simple yet effective method that performs training with unlabeled pairs to complement both limited image pairs and sparse point pairs, requiring neither extra labeled keypoints nor trainable modules. We fundamentally extend the data quantity and variety by augmenting new unannotated pairs not primitively provided as training pairs in benchmarks. Using a simple teacher-student framework, we offer reliable pseudo correspondences to the student network via machine supervision. Finally, the performance of our network is steadily improved by the proposed iterative training, putting back the student as a teacher to generate refined labels and train a new student repeatedly. Our models outperform the milestone baselines, including state-of-the-art methods on semantic correspondence benchmarks."
