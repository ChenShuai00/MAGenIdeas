    "title": "Three Recipes for Better 3D Pseudo-GTs of 3D Human Mesh Estimation in the Wild",
    "abstract": "Recovering 3D human mesh in the wild is greatly challenging as in-the-wild (ITW) datasets provide only 2D pose ground truths (GTs). Recently, 3D pseudo-GTs have been widely used to train 3D human mesh estimation networks as the 3D pseudo-GTs enable 3D mesh supervision when training the networks on ITW datasets. However, despite the great potential of the 3D pseudo-GTs, there has been no extensive analysis that investigates which factors are important to make more beneficial 3D pseudo-GTs. In this paper, we provide three recipes to obtain highly beneficial 3D pseudo-GTs of ITW datasets. The main challenge is that only 2D-based weak supervision is allowed when obtaining the 3D pseudo-GTs. Each of our three recipes addresses the challenge in each aspect: depth ambiguity, sub-optimality of weak supervision, and implausible articulation. Experimental results show that simply re-training state-of-the-art networks with our new 3D pseudo-GTs elevates their performance to the next level without bells and whistles. The 3D pseudo-GT is publicly available1."
