    "title": "Generating Empathetic Responses by Looking Ahead the User\u2019s Sentiment",
    "abstract": "An important aspect of human conversation difficult for machines is conversing with empathy, which is to understand the user\u2019s emotion and respond appropriately. Recent neural conversation models that attempted to generate empathetic responses either focused on conditioning the output to a given emotion, or incorporating the current user emotional state. However, these approaches do not factor in how the user would feel towards the generated response. Hence, in this paper, we propose Sentiment Look-ahead, which is a novel perspective for empathy that models the future user emotional state. In short, Sentiment Look-ahead is a reward function under a reinforcement learning framework that provides a higher reward to the generative model when the generated utterance improves the user\u2019s sentiment. We implement and evaluate three different possible implementations of sentiment look-ahead and empirically show that our proposed approach can generate significantly more empathetic, relevant, and fluent responses than other competitive baselines such as multitask learning."
