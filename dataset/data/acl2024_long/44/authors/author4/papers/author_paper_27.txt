    "title": "Hierarchical Committee of Deep CNNs with Exponentially-Weighted Decision Fusion for Static Facial Expression Recognition",
    "abstract": "We present a pattern recognition framework to improve committee machines of deep convolutional neural networks (deep CNNs) and its application to static facial expression recognition in the wild (SFEW). In order to generate enough diversity of decisions, we trained multiple deep CNNs by varying network architectures, input normalization, and weight initialization as well as by adopting several learning strategies to use large external databases. Moreover, with these deep models, we formed hierarchical committees using the validation-accuracy-based exponentially-weighted average (VA-Expo-WA) rule. Through extensive experiments, the great strengths of our committee machines were demonstrated in both structural and decisional ways. On the SFEW2.0 dataset released for the 3rd Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) sub-challenge, a test accuracy of 57.3% was obtained from the best single deep CNN, while the single-level committees yielded 58.3% and 60.5% with the simple average rule and with the VA-Expo-WA rule, respectively. Our final submission based on the 3-level hierarchy using the VA-Expo-WA achieved 61.6%, significantly higher than the SFEW baseline of 39.1%."
