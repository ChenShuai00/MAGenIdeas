    "title": "Robust Natural Language Watermarking through Invariant Features",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of valuable original natural language contents found in subscription-based media out-lets, web novel platforms, and outputs of large language models. Without proper security measures, however, these contents are susceptible to illegal piracy and potential misuse. This calls for a secure watermarking system to guarantee copyright protection through leakage tracing or ownership identi\ufb01cation. To effectively combat piracy and protect copyrights, a watermarking framework should be able not only to embed adequate bits of information but also extract the watermarks in a robust manner despite possible corruption. In this work, we explore ways to advance both payload and robustness by following a well-known proposition from image watermarking and identify features in natural language that are invariant to minor corruption. Through a systematic analysis of the possible sources of errors, we further propose a corruption-resistant in-\ufb01ll model. Our full method improves upon the previous work on robustness by +16.8% point on average on four datasets, three corruption types, and two corruption ratios. 1"
