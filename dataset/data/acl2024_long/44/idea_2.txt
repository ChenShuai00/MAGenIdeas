    "Title": "Multi-Modal Watermarking for Code and Text Generation Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-modal watermarking approach that can be applied to both code and text generation models. The method involves embedding watermarks in both the syntactic and semantic structures of the generated content, making it more difficult to remove or alter. The watermarking process is designed to be compatible with existing code and text generation models, allowing for easy integration. The detection mechanism uses a combination of syntactic and semantic analysis to identify watermarked content, even after significant modifications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' and 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' theories. By combining syntactic and semantic watermarking, the method addresses the limitations of current approaches that focus on only one aspect of the generated content. The 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings' theory is also relevant, as multi-modal watermarking could reveal new insights into how different modalities interact in AI-generated content.",
    "Rationale": "Current watermarking methods are often limited to either code or text, but not both. A multi-modal approach could provide a more comprehensive solution, especially for applications that involve both code and text generation. This method is particularly relevant for AI systems that generate mixed content, such as documentation or tutorials. The integration of syntactic and semantic analysis also opens up new research directions, making it a strong candidate for top-tier conferences.",
