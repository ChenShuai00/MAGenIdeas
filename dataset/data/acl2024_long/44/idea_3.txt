    "Title": "Explainable Watermarking for AI-Generated Code",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an explainable watermarking framework for AI-generated code that provides insights into how and where the watermark is embedded. The framework includes a visualization tool that allows users to see the watermarking process in real-time, making it easier to understand and verify. The watermarking method itself is designed to be transparent, with clear rules for embedding and detection. The framework also includes a feedback mechanism that allows users to report issues with the watermarking process, which can be used to improve the method over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on the 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings' and 'Designing Critical Experiments' theories. Explainability is a key concern in AI, and applying it to watermarking could improve user trust and adoption. The 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' theory is also relevant, as the framework could lead to new theoretical insights into how watermarks interact with AI-generated content.",
    "Rationale": "Explainability is increasingly important in AI systems, and watermarking is no exception. By providing a transparent and explainable watermarking framework, this method could improve user trust and adoption, especially in sensitive applications like code generation. The feedback mechanism also ensures that the method can be continuously improved, making it a strong candidate for top-tier conferences.",
