    "Title": "Watermarking for Federated Code Generation Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a watermarking framework specifically designed for federated code generation models. The framework allows multiple parties to collaboratively train a code generation model while ensuring that each party's contributions are watermarked. The watermarking process is designed to be robust against model aggregation and other forms of manipulation that are common in federated learning. The detection mechanism uses a combination of model-specific and global watermarks to identify the source of generated code, even in a federated setting.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' and 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' theories. Federated learning presents unique challenges for watermarking, and this framework addresses those challenges by combining model-specific and global watermarks. The 'Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings' theory is also relevant, as federated learning often reveals unexpected patterns in model behavior that can be leveraged for watermarking.",
    "Rationale": "Federated learning is becoming increasingly popular for training AI models, including code generation models. However, current watermarking methods are not designed for federated settings, making it difficult to protect intellectual property. This framework provides a solution that is specifically tailored to federated learning, making it a strong candidate for top-tier conferences.",
