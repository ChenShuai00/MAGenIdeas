    "Title": "Explainable Watermarking for Code Generation: Providing Insights into Watermark Detection",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an explainable watermarking framework for code generation, where the watermark detection process is made transparent and interpretable. The framework uses explainable AI techniques to provide insights into how the watermark is detected, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind the detection process. The watermark is embedded in a way that allows for easy interpretation, and the detection process is designed to provide detailed explanations for its decisions. This approach not only improves the transparency of watermark detection but also helps users trust the detection process, making it more suitable for real-world applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Propose New Hypotheses' theory (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method) and 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' theory (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). By drawing an analogy from explainable AI, we hypothesize that watermark detection can be made more transparent and interpretable. This creative leap leads to a new method for watermarking that provides insights into the detection process. The integration of explainable AI with watermarking is a novel approach that could significantly improve the usability and trustworthiness of watermark detection.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that traditional watermarking methods are often opaque, making it difficult for users to understand how the watermark is detected. By proposing an explainable watermarking framework, we can improve the transparency and interpretability of the detection process. This approach has the potential to make watermark detection more trustworthy and suitable for real-world applications, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences. The idea is novel and addresses a critical challenge in the field, making it highly impactful.",
