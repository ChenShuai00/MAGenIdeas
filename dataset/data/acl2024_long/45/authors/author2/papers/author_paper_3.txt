    "title": "VideoLights: Feature Refinement and Cross-Task Alignment Transformer for Joint Video Highlight Detection and Moment Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Video Highlight Detection and Moment Retrieval (HD/MR) are essential in video analysis. Recent joint prediction transformer models often overlook their cross-task dynamics and video-text alignment and refinement. Moreover, most models typically use limited, uni-directional attention mechanisms, resulting in weakly integrated representations and suboptimal performance in capturing the interdependence between video and text modalities. Although large-language and vision-language models (LLM/LVLMs) have gained prominence across various domains, their application in this field remains relatively underexplored. Here we propose VideoLights, a novel HD/MR framework addressing these limitations through (i) Convolutional Projection and Feature Refinement modules with an alignment loss for better video-text feature alignment, (ii) Bi-Directional Cross-Modal Fusion network for strongly coupled query-aware clip representations, and (iii) Uni-directional joint-task feedback mechanism enhancing both tasks through correlation. In addition, (iv) we introduce hard positive/negative losses for adaptive error penalization and improved learning, and (v) leverage LVLMs like BLIP-2 for enhanced multimodal feature integration and intelligent pretraining using synthetic data generated from LVLMs. Comprehensive experiments on QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.
