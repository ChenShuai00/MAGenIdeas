    "Title": "Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent Code Generation with Dynamic Context Filtering",
    "Idea": "This idea enhances the MapCoder framework by integrating a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism with dynamic context filtering. The system will retrieve relevant code snippets, documentation, and problem-solving strategies from a large-scale code corpus during the code generation process. A novel dynamic context filtering module will evaluate the relevance and quality of retrieved information, ensuring that only the most useful context is provided to the agents. This approach aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of code generation, particularly for complex and niche programming tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which focuses on improving existing methods by integrating new technologies and tools. The retrieval-augmented generation approach is a natural extension of the MapCoder framework, addressing its limitation in leveraging external knowledge. The dynamic context filtering module is inspired by **Feyerabend’s methodological anarchism**, which encourages exploring unconventional methods to solve problems. By combining retrieval with intelligent filtering, we create a more robust and efficient code generation system.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current code generation systems often lack access to relevant external knowledge, leading to suboptimal solutions. By integrating retrieval-augmented generation with dynamic context filtering, we enable the system to leverage a vast repository of code and documentation, improving its ability to handle complex tasks. This approach aligns with the trend in AI research towards incorporating external knowledge sources, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
