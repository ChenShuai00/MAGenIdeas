    "Title": "Self-Collaborative Debugging: Multi-Agent Code Generation with Iterative Self-Improvement",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a self-collaborative debugging mechanism within the MapCoder framework, where agents iteratively debug and refine their generated code without human intervention. Each agent will have a specialized role in the debugging process (e.g., error detection, root cause analysis, and solution generation). The system will use a feedback loop where agents learn from their debugging experiences, improving their ability to identify and fix errors over time. This approach aims to enhance the robustness and reliability of the generated code, particularly for competitive programming tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings**, which focuses on explaining and integrating anomalous findings into the scientific process. In the context of code generation, errors and bugs are anomalies that need to be addressed. The iterative self-improvement process is informed by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**, where agents use analogical reasoning and creative leaps to refine their solutions. By enabling agents to collaboratively debug their code, we create a more robust and self-sufficient system.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that debugging is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of code generation. Current systems, including MapCoder, rely on external tools or human intervention for debugging, which limits their autonomy. By introducing a self-collaborative debugging mechanism, we enable the system to iteratively improve its outputs, reducing the need for human oversight. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the reliability of code generation systems, making it a strong contender for a best paper award."
