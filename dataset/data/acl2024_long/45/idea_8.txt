    "Title": "Cross-Domain Multi-Agent Code Generation with Transfer Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a transfer learning framework for the MapCoder system, enabling it to generalize across different programming domains (e.g., web development, data science, and competitive programming). The framework will pre-train the agents on a diverse set of programming tasks and languages, then fine-tune them for specific domains. A domain adaptation module will dynamically adjust the agents' strategies based on the target domain, ensuring optimal performance. This approach aims to address the limitation of current code generation systems, which are often domain-specific and lack generalization capabilities.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Kitcher’s unified theory of science**, which emphasizes the importance of unifying knowledge across different domains. The transfer learning framework is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**, which focuses on identifying common patterns and structures across multiple studies. By unifying knowledge from different programming domains, we create a more versatile and generalizable code generation system. The domain adaptation module is informed by **Quine’s holism**, which advocates for a holistic approach to problem-solving.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current code generation systems are often limited to specific domains, making them less useful for real-world applications. By introducing a transfer learning framework, we enable the MapCoder system to generalize across different programming domains, significantly expanding its applicability. This approach aligns with the growing demand for versatile AI systems, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
