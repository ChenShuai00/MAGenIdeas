    "Title": "Self-Debugging Multi-Agent Code Generation with Explainable Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea enhances the MapCoder framework by incorporating a self-debugging mechanism with explainable feedback. Each agent is equipped with the ability to generate natural language explanations for its actions, such as why a particular code snippet was generated or why a specific debugging step was taken. These explanations are shared among agents to improve collaboration and decision-making. Additionally, the framework includes a feedback loop where agents can critique and refine each other's explanations, leading to more accurate and interpretable code generation. This approach improves the transparency and reliability of the system, making it easier for developers to understand and trust the generated code.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Simonâ€™s scientific discovery as problem-solving**, which emphasizes the importance of intuition and creative leaps in generating new hypotheses. The self-debugging mechanism is a creative leap that borrows concepts from explainable AI and applies them to multi-agent code generation. The use of natural language explanations improves the interpretability of the system, addressing a key limitation in current code generation models. The feedback loop is a novel contribution that leverages the strengths of multi-agent collaboration to refine explanations and improve decision-making.",
    "Rationale": "Self-debugging with explainable feedback improves the transparency and reliability of the system, making it easier for developers to understand and trust the generated code. The feedback loop ensures continuous improvement, leading to more accurate and interpretable code generation. This approach addresses a key limitation in current code generation systems, which often lack transparency and interpretability. The novelty and practical impact of this idea make it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences."
