    "Title": "Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent Code Generation with Dynamic Context Integration",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes enhancing the MapCoder framework with a retrieval-augmented mechanism that dynamically integrates relevant code snippets and documentation from a large-scale code repository. The retrieval system will use dense retrieval techniques to find the most relevant examples, which will then be provided as additional context to the multi-agent system. This approach will improve the system's ability to handle complex programming tasks by leveraging existing knowledge and patterns from similar problems. The retrieval mechanism will be adaptive, updating its database in real-time based on the feedback from the multi-agent system, ensuring that the most relevant and up-to-date information is always available.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which emphasizes the importance of integrating interdisciplinary knowledge to discover new problems and solutions. The retrieval-augmented approach is a natural extension of this model, as it leverages existing knowledge from a large corpus of code to enhance the capabilities of the multi-agent system. Additionally, **Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory** is used to abstract and summarize the general laws behind multiple related studies, ensuring that the retrieval mechanism is both effective and efficient. This approach addresses a critical limitation in current code generation models, which often lack the ability to leverage external knowledge effectively.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that retrieval-augmented methods have been shown to significantly improve the performance of language models in various tasks, including code generation. By integrating a dynamic retrieval mechanism into the MapCoder framework, we can enhance its ability to handle complex programming tasks, particularly those that require domain-specific knowledge or patterns. This approach has the potential to set a new standard for code generation models, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like ACL and CVPR."
