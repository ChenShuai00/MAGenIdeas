    "Title": "MetaMapCoder: Meta-Learning for Adaptive Multi-Agent Code Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a meta-learning framework integrated into the MapCoder architecture, enabling the multi-agent system to adaptively learn and optimize its code generation strategies across diverse programming tasks and languages. The framework will use meta-learning to train the agents to generalize better across unseen problem domains, dynamically adjust their roles (e.g., planner, debugger), and improve collaboration efficiency. The system will also incorporate a feedback loop where agents learn from their mistakes and successes, refining their strategies over time. This approach aims to address the limitations of static multi-agent systems, which often struggle with generalization and adaptability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes exploring the boundaries of existing paradigms. The current MapCoder framework, while effective, relies on fixed agent roles and strategies, limiting its adaptability. By introducing meta-learning, we push the theoretical boundaries of multi-agent code generation, enabling the system to dynamically adapt to new challenges. Additionally, **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** informs the use of analogical reasoning, where the agents learn from past experiences (meta-learning) to solve new problems creatively.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the need for code generation systems to handle increasingly complex and diverse programming tasks. Current systems, including MapCoder, are limited by their static architectures, which cannot easily adapt to new domains or languages. Meta-learning offers a way to overcome this limitation by enabling agents to learn how to learn, improving their generalization capabilities. This idea has the potential to significantly advance the field of code generation, making it more robust and versatile, which is a key criterion for best paper awards."
