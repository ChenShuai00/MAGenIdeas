    "Title": "ExplainableMapCoder: Interpretable Multi-Agent Code Generation with Natural Language Rationales",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes extending the MapCoder framework to include natural language rationales for each step of the code generation process. Each agent in the multi-agent system will generate not only code but also a natural language explanation of its reasoning. These explanations will be integrated into a unified rationale that provides a clear and interpretable overview of the code generation process. This approach will make the system more transparent and easier to debug, particularly for complex programming tasks where understanding the reasoning behind the generated code is critical.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**, which emphasizes the importance of intuition and creative leaps in the discovery process. The generation of natural language rationales is a creative leap that addresses a significant gap in current code generation models, which often lack interpretability. Additionally, **Lakoff’s conceptual metaphor theory** is used to construct a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between code and natural language, making the system more accessible to non-experts. This approach aligns with the growing demand for explainable AI in software engineering.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that interpretability is a critical factor in the adoption of AI systems in real-world applications. By providing natural language rationales for each step of the code generation process, ExplainableMapCoder can improve the transparency and trustworthiness of the system. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way developers interact with code generation models, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like NeurIPS and ICLR."
