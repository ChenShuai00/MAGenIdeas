    "Title": "Explainable Multi-Agent Code Generation with Human-in-the-Loop Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea enhances the MapCoder framework by incorporating explainability and human-in-the-loop feedback. The system will generate not only code but also natural language explanations of the reasoning behind each step. A human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism will allow developers to provide feedback on the generated code and explanations, which the agents will use to refine their strategies. This approach aims to improve the transparency and usability of the code generation system, particularly for non-expert users.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Toulmin’s model of conceptual evolution**, which emphasizes the importance of explanations in scientific discovery. The explainability component is informed by **Lakoff’s conceptual metaphor theory**, which focuses on making complex concepts accessible through analogies and explanations. The human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism is grounded in **Laudan’s problem-solving progress assessment**, which highlights the importance of iterative improvement based on feedback. By incorporating explainability and human feedback, we create a more transparent and user-friendly code generation system.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that explainability and usability are critical for the adoption of AI systems in real-world applications. Current code generation systems, including MapCoder, often lack transparency, making it difficult for users to understand and trust their outputs. By incorporating explainability and human-in-the-loop feedback, we address this limitation, making the system more accessible to non-expert users. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the usability of code generation systems, making it a strong contender for a best paper award."
