    "Title": "CollaborativeMapCoder: Multi-Agent Code Generation with Human-in-the-Loop Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes extending the MapCoder framework to include a human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism, where human developers can provide real-time feedback to the multi-agent system during the code generation process. The feedback will be used to refine the generated code and improve the system's performance over time. This approach will be particularly useful for tasks that require a high degree of precision, such as software development in safety-critical domains. The human-in-the-loop mechanism will be integrated into each agent, allowing the entire system to benefit from human expertise.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Mayo’s experimental reasoning theory**, which emphasizes the importance of designing experiments that can distinguish competing theories. The human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism is a novel experimental design that allows the system to learn from human expertise in real-time. Additionally, **Sutton’s model of scientific serendipity** is used to explore the potential for unexpected discoveries through the interaction between human developers and the multi-agent system. This approach addresses a critical limitation in current code generation models, which often lack the ability to incorporate human feedback effectively.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that human expertise is a critical factor in the success of AI systems in real-world applications. By integrating a human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism into the MapCoder framework, CollaborativeMapCoder can achieve state-of-the-art performance in tasks that require a high degree of precision, such as software development in safety-critical domains. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way developers interact with code generation models, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like NeurIPS and ICLR."
