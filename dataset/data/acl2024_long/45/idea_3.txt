    "Title": "MetaMapCoder: Meta-Learning for Adaptive Multi-Agent Code Generation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes integrating meta-learning techniques into the MapCoder framework to enable the multi-agent system to adapt to new programming tasks and languages with minimal additional training. The meta-learning component will allow the system to quickly learn from a small number of examples, making it more flexible and versatile. This approach will be particularly useful for tasks that require rapid adaptation, such as competitive programming or cross-language code translation. The meta-learning mechanism will be integrated into each agent, allowing the entire system to adapt dynamically to new challenges.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Quine’s holism**, which emphasizes the importance of balancing reductionism and emergence in scientific discovery. The integration of meta-learning into the MapCoder framework is a holistic approach that addresses the need for adaptability in code generation models. Additionally, **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** is used to develop an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that combines insights from machine learning, software engineering, and cognitive science. This approach pushes the boundaries of current code generation models, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like NeurIPS and ICLR.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that adaptability is a critical factor in the success of AI systems in real-world applications. By integrating meta-learning techniques into the MapCoder framework, MetaMapCoder can achieve state-of-the-art performance in tasks that require rapid adaptation, such as competitive programming or cross-language code translation. This approach has the potential to set a new standard for code generation models, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences."
