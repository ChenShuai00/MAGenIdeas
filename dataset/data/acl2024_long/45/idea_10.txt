    "Title": "MapCoder++: Multi-Agent Code Generation with Dynamic Role Adaptation and Self-Optimization",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the MapCoder framework by introducing dynamic role adaptation and self-optimization mechanisms for the LLM agents. Instead of fixed roles (e.g., recalling, planning, coding, debugging), each agent can dynamically adapt its role based on the problem context and feedback from other agents. For example, if the debugging agent identifies a recurring issue in the generated code, it can temporarily take on the role of the planner to suggest alternative strategies. Additionally, the framework will incorporate a self-optimization loop where agents iteratively refine their prompts and strategies based on performance metrics (e.g., pass@k rates, execution time). This approach will improve the robustness and adaptability of the system, enabling it to handle more complex and diverse programming tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes identifying anomalies and exploring theoretical boundaries. The current MapCoder framework assumes fixed roles for agents, which may limit its adaptability to different problem contexts. By introducing dynamic role adaptation, we address this limitation and push the boundaries of multi-agent collaboration. Additionally, **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** guides the use of analogical reasoning to borrow concepts from adaptive systems in other domains (e.g., reinforcement learning) and apply them to code generation. The self-optimization loop is a creative leap that leverages feedback-driven improvement, a concept commonly used in machine learning but not yet fully explored in multi-agent code generation.",
    "Rationale": "Dynamic role adaptation allows the system to handle a wider range of programming tasks by reallocating resources and expertise as needed. The self-optimization loop ensures continuous improvement, making the framework more robust and scalable. These enhancements address key limitations in current multi-agent systems, such as rigidity and lack of adaptability, and have the potential to significantly improve performance on competitive programming benchmarks. The novelty and practical impact of this idea make it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences."
