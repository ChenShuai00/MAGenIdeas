    "Title": "MapCoder-Edge: Multi-Agent Code Generation for Resource-Constrained Environments",
    "Idea": "This idea adapts the MapCoder framework for resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or low-power systems. The framework is optimized to reduce computational overhead by using lightweight LLM agents and efficient communication protocols. For example, the recalling agent can use a compressed memory module to store and retrieve relevant code snippets, while the coding agent can generate code in a more compact format. Additionally, the framework includes a resource-aware scheduling mechanism that prioritizes tasks based on their complexity and available resources. This approach enables the system to generate high-quality code in resource-constrained environments, making it suitable for applications such as IoT devices and embedded systems.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Popperâ€™s falsificationism**, which emphasizes the importance of critically analyzing existing methods and exploring their limitations. The current MapCoder framework is designed for high-performance environments, but its applicability to resource-constrained environments is underexplored. By optimizing the framework for resource-constrained environments, we address this limitation and expand its potential applications. The resource-aware scheduling mechanism is a creative leap that leverages concepts from edge computing and resource management, enabling the system to generate high-quality code in low-resource settings.",
    "Rationale": "Resource-constrained environments pose unique challenges for code generation, such as limited computational power and memory. The optimized MapCoder-Edge framework addresses these challenges by using lightweight LLM agents and efficient communication protocols. The resource-aware scheduling mechanism ensures that the system can generate high-quality code even in low-resource settings. This approach expands the potential applications of multi-agent code generation, making it suitable for IoT devices and embedded systems. The novelty and practical impact of this idea make it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences."
