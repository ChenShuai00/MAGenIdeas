    "Title": "RobustMapCoder: Enhancing Multi-Agent Code Generation with Adversarial Training and Self-Debugging",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an extension of the MapCoder framework by integrating adversarial training and self-debugging mechanisms. The multi-agent system will be trained using adversarial examples to improve robustness against edge cases and adversarial inputs. Additionally, a self-debugging agent will be introduced to iteratively refine generated code by identifying and fixing errors without human intervention. The self-debugging agent will use natural language explanations to guide the debugging process, making the system more interpretable and reliable. This approach aims to address the limitations of current multi-agent systems in handling complex, real-world programming tasks where robustness and correctness are critical.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes identifying anomalies in existing theories and exploring theoretical boundaries. The current MapCoder framework, while effective, may struggle with adversarial inputs and edge cases, which are common in competitive programming. By integrating adversarial training, we can push the boundaries of the framework to handle such scenarios. Additionally, **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is used to propose the self-debugging agent, which is a creative leap inspired by the concept of rubber duck debugging in software engineering. This agent will enhance the interpretability and reliability of the system, addressing a significant gap in current code generation models.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is twofold. First, adversarial training is a proven method for improving the robustness of machine learning models, and its application to multi-agent code generation is novel and impactful. Second, self-debugging mechanisms are essential for real-world applications where human intervention is impractical. By combining these two elements, RobustMapCoder can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both robustness and correctness, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like NeurIPS and ICLR."
