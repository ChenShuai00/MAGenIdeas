    "title": "Farasa: A Fast and Furious Segmenter for Arabic",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Farasa, a fast and accurate Arabic segmenter. Our approach is based on SVM-rank using linear kernels. We measure the performance of the seg-menter in terms of accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency, in two NLP tasks, namely Machine Translation (MT) and Information Retrieval (IR). Farasa outperforms or is at par with the state-of-the-art Arabic segmenters (Stanford and MADAMIRA), while being more than one order of magnitude faster."
