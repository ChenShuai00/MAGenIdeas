    "title": "Good Secretaries, Bad Truck Drivers? Occupational Gender Stereotypes in Sentiment Analysis",
    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the presence of occupational gender stereotypes in sentiment analysis models. Such a task has implications in reducing implicit biases in these models, which are being applied to an increasingly wide variety of downstream tasks. We release a new gender-balanced dataset of 800 sentences pertaining to specific professions and propose a methodology for using it as a test bench to evaluate sentiment analysis models. We evaluate the presence of occupational gender stereotypes in 3 different models using our approach, and explore their relationship with societal perceptions of occupations."
