    "title": "Improving the Behavioral Intention of Continuous Online Learning Among Learners in Higher Education During COVID-19",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused colleges and universities to rely heavily on online learning to continue knowledge dissemination to learners. This study used the second-generation model of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) to comprehensively analyze the mediating effects of self-efficacy, which affects learners\u2019 effective use of online tools for learning, and capability of metacognition and self-regulation, which can independently adjust learning progress into the UTAUT2 model, on the learner\u2019s willingness to continue online learning [i.e., their behavioral intention (BI)] by constructing a UTAUT2-based e-learning model. This study administered questionnaires to undergraduates in universities in East China to collect data. The effects of performance expectancy, effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), and facilitating conditions (FCs), hedonic motivation (HM), price value (PV), and habits on BI (directly or through mediators) were analyzed through data analysis and structural equation modeling, and the UTAUT2-based e-learning model was accordingly modified. The results indicated that the self-efficacy enhanced the effects of EE, SI, FCs, HM, and PV on learners\u2019 BI; that metacognition and self-regulation (MS) capabilities enhanced the effects of EE on learners\u2019 BI; and that habits had a direct and strong effect on BI. This study also provided some suggestions to enhance higher education learners\u2019 willingness to continue online learning, such as improving social recognition and support, careful design of teaching content, easy-to-use technology, financial support. These results and suggestions may guide colleges and universities in conducting, continuing, or enhancing online education, particularly as the pandemic continues."
