    "title": "Changes in the socially shared regulation, academic emotions, and product performance in venue-based collaborative learning",
    "abstract": "Teachers\u2019 knowledge of the socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) process of learners, which consists of the task analysis, planning, elaboration, and monitoring, can help teachers intervene when students face difficulties during the collaborative learning. Students\u2019 academic emotions have major effects on their learning motivation, cognition, and performance. This study investigated the changes in SSRL, academic emotions, and product performance of high-, medium-, and low-level groups students after they visited an educational technology center and collaboratively designed a learning environment. We recruited 36 juniors majoring in educational technology. Online group discussions were recorded using online chat tools, and a heuristic mining algorithm was employed on this chat data to determine SSRL processes. The participants were asked to express opinions on their major, and this feedback was used to obtain academic emotion information. Additionally, a scoring was employed to measure the participants\u2019 product performance. The high-level group was discovered to exhibit all four SSRL phases and exhibit positive emotions, with activating emotions more common than deactivating emotions. SSRL was discovered to be related to academic performance; higher academic performance correlated with a more standardized SSRL process. Additionally, the higher a participants\u2019 academic performance, the more frequently the participant had positive academic emotions. Overall, the learners in the high-level group paid more attention to the collaborative learning task."
