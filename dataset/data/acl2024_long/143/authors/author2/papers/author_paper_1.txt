    "title": "The impact of interaction on continuous use in online learning platforms: a metaverse perspective",
    "abstract": "PurposeAs online learning is the embryonic form of education in the metaverse, it is extremely important to explore the behavioral preferences of users. The aim is to explore the impact of interactive features on continuous use in online learning and to further explore what kind of interaction mode should be constructed for different types of students to obtain the best educational experience.Design/methodology/approachThe study developed an empirical model and used a real-world dataset to test hypotheses. Specifically, the interaction in online learning is analyzed from different dimensions, including the interaction intensity of multiple subjects, the immersion of interactive technology, the timeliness of interactive feedback, and the fun in interaction.FindingsThe authors found that the intensity of interaction, immersion, timeliness of feedback and fun in the interaction all had significant positive effects on continuous use. Among them, the most important is the interaction between teachers and students. With the growth of user grades, the role of parents in the interaction is getting smaller and smaller, and the fun in the interaction is gradually becoming unnecessary. For high school students, gamified interactions can even have a negative impact. In addition, from the perspective of gender, males prefer immersive interaction, while females pay more attention to themselves and have negative feedback on fees.Originality/valueThe authors deepened the interaction and summarized the impact of different interactive features on continuous use in online learning platforms. The authors focused on the impact of the immersive experience brought by the application of interactive technology, which can confirm the user behavior preferences of online learning in the context of the metaverse. The research also provides a reference for online learning institutions to set up course interaction modes and targeted marketing programs."
