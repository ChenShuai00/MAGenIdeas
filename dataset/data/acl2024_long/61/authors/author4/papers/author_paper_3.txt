    "title": "Papeos: Augmenting Research Papers with Talk Videos",
    "abstract": "Research consumption has been traditionally limited to the reading of academic papers\u2014a static, dense, and formally written format. Alternatively, pre-recorded conference presentation videos, which are more dynamic, concise, and colloquial, have recently become more widely available but potentially under-utilized. In this work, we explore the design space and benefits for combining academic papers and talk videos to leverage their complementary nature to provide a rich and fluid research consumption experience. Based on formative and co-design studies, we present Papeos, a novel reading and authoring interface that allow authors to augment their papers by segmenting and localizing talk videos alongside relevant paper passages with automatically generated suggestions. With Papeos, readers can visually skim a paper through clip thumbnails, and fluidly switch between consuming dense text in the paper or visual summaries in the video. In a comparative lab study (n=16), Papeos reduced mental load, scaffolded navigation, and facilitated more comprehensive reading of papers."
