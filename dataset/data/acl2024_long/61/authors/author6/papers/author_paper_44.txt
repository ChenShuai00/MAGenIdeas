    "title": "LIMEADE: From AI Explanations to Advice Taking",
    "abstract": "Research in human-centered AI has shown the benefits of systems that can explain their predictions. Methods that allow AI to take advice from humans in response to explanations are similarly useful. While both capabilities are well developed for transparent learning models (e.g., linear models and GA2Ms) and recent techniques (e.g., LIME and SHAP) can generate explanations for opaque models, little attention has been given to advice methods for opaque models. This article introduces LIMEADE, the first general framework that translates both positive and negative advice (expressed using high-level vocabulary such as that employed by post hoc explanations) into an update to an arbitrary, underlying opaque model. We demonstrate the generality of our approach with case studies on 70 real-world models across two broad domains: image classification and text recommendation. We show that our method improves accuracy compared to a rigorous baseline on the image classification domains. For the text modality, we apply our framework to a neural recommender system for scientific papers on a public website; our user study shows that our framework leads to significantly higher perceived user control, trust, and satisfaction."
