    "title": "Tablet-based video modeling and prompting in the workplace for individuals with autism",
    "abstract": "The current study involved a preliminary job-site testing of computer software, i.e., VideoTote, delivered via a computer tablet and designed to provide users with video modeling and prompting for use by young adults with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) across a range of employment settings. A multiple baseline design was used to assess changes in rates of completion with a complex, 104-step shipping task by four participants diagnosed with ASD. Baseline data were collected on accuracy of task completion after exposure to typical job-training involving instruction, modeling, and practice. The intervention involved video modeling and prompting with a 13 minute video depicting an individual completing job responsibilities that entailed checking to make sure materials were in working order, replacing defective items, packing materials in a container, entering information into a computer, and attaching a label to a container. Results suggested that video modeling and prompting were effective in helping individuals with autism complete a multi-step shipping task. Participants and their parents gave the device and software high ratings as an acceptable treatment for adults with autism to use in the workplace and intervention that complies with universal design principles. Implications for competitive job opportunities for individuals with autism are discussed."
