Citation con-002 tent analysis using NLP methods has been pro-003 posed to bene\ufb01t tasks such as scienti\ufb01c pa-004 per summarization and research impact assess-005 ment. In this paper, we propose a new task, ci-006 tation subject matter extraction , and augment 007 an existing citation sentiment corpus with cita-008 tion context and subject matter annotations to 009 enable a \ufb01ner-grained study of citation content. 010 We propose a BERT-based multi-task model to 011 jointly address these three classi\ufb01cation tasks 012 (i.e., context, subject matter, and sentiment) by 013 enabling knowledge transfer across tasks. Our 014 experimental results show the effectiveness of 015 our joint model over single task models. We 016 also obtain state-of-the-art results for the cita-017 tion sentiment classi\ufb01cation task and demon-018 strate that isolating the subject matter signif-019 icantly improves this task. Our error analy-020 sis suggests improving annotation consistency 021 and using external knowledge sources could 022 further improve performance. We will make 023 our code, data, and annotation guidelines pub-024 licly available upon acceptance. 025"
