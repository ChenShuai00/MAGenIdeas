    "title": "LeKUBE: A Legal Knowledge Update BEnchmark",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly shaped the applications of AI in multiple fields, including the studies of legal intelligence. Trained on extensive legal texts, including statutes and legal documents, the legal LLMs can capture important legal knowledge/concepts effectively and provide important support for downstream legal applications such as legal consultancy. Yet, the dynamic nature of legal statutes and interpretations also poses new challenges to the use of LLMs in legal applications. Particularly, how to update the legal knowledge of LLMs effectively and efficiently has become an important research problem in practice. Existing benchmarks for evaluating knowledge update methods are mostly designed for the open domain and cannot address the specific challenges of the legal domain, such as the nuanced application of new legal knowledge, the complexity and lengthiness of legal regulations, and the intricate nature of legal reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce the Legal Knowledge Update BEnchmark, i.e. LeKUBE, which evaluates knowledge update methods for legal LLMs across five dimensions. Specifically, we categorize the needs of knowledge updates in the legal domain with the help of legal professionals, and then hire annotators from law schools to create synthetic updates to the Chinese Criminal and Civil Code as well as sets of questions of which the answers would change after the updates. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge update methods, we reveal a notable gap between existing knowledge update methods and the unique needs of the legal domain, emphasizing the need for further research and development of knowledge update mechanisms tailored for legal LLMs."
