    "title": "Relevance Feedback with Brain Signals",
    "abstract": "The Relevance Feedback (RF) process relies on accurate and real-time relevance estimation of feedback documents to improve retrieval performance. Since collecting explicit relevance annotations imposes an extra burden on the user, extensive studies have explored using pseudo-relevance signals and implicit feedback signals as substitutes. However, such signals are indirect indicators of relevance and suffer from complex search scenarios where user interactions are absent or biased. Recently, the advances in portable and high-precision brain-computer interface (BCI) devices have shown the possibility to monitor user\u2019s brain activities during search process. Brain signals can directly reflect user\u2019s psychological responses to search results and thus it can act as additional and unbiased RF signals. To explore the effectiveness of brain signals in the context of RF, we propose a novel RF framework that combines BCI-based RF with pseudo-relevance signals and implicit signals to improve the performance of document re-ranking. The experimental results on the user study dataset show that incorporating brain signals leads to significant performance improvement in our RF framework. Besides, we observe that brain signals perform particularly well in several hard search scenarios, especially when implicit signals as feedback are missing or noisy. This reveals when and how to exploit brain signals in the context of RF."
