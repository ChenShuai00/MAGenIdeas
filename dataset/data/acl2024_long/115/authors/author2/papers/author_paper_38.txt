    "title": "Caseformer: Pre-training for Legal Case Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Legal case retrieval aims to help legal workers find relevant cases related to their cases at hand, which is important for the guarantee of fairness and justice in legal judgments. While recent advances in neural retrieval methods have significantly improved the performance of open-domain retrieval tasks (e.g., Web search), their advantages have not been observed in legal case retrieval due to their thirst for annotated data. As annotating large-scale training data in legal domains is prohibitive due to the need for domain expertise, traditional search techniques based on lexical matching such as TF-IDF, BM25, and Query Likelihood are still prevalent in legal case retrieval systems. While previous studies have designed several pre-training methods for IR models in open-domain tasks, these methods are usually suboptimal in legal case retrieval because they cannot understand and capture the key knowledge and data structures in the legal corpus. To this end, we propose a novel pre-training framework named Caseformer that enables the pre-trained models to learn legal knowledge and domain-specific relevance information in legal case retrieval without any human-labeled data. Through three unsupervised learning tasks, Caseformer is able to capture the special language, document structure, and relevance patterns of legal case documents, making it a strong backbone for downstream legal case retrieval tasks. Experimental results show that our model has achieved state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot and full-data fine-tuning settings. Also, experiments on both Chinese and English legal datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of Caseformer is language-independent in legal case retrieval."
