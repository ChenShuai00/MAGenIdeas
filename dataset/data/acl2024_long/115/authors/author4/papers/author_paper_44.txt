    "abstract": "We present the Legal Passage Retrieval Dataset, 001 LePaRD. LePaRD is a massive collection of 002 over 4 million U.S. federal judicial citations 003 to precedent in context. The dataset aims to 004 facilitate work on legal passage retrieval, a 005 challenging practice-oriented legal retrieval and 006 reasoning task. Legal passage retrieval seeks 007 to predict relevant passages from precedential 008 court decisions given the context of a legal ar-009 gument. We extensively evaluate various re-010 trieval approaches on LePaRD"
