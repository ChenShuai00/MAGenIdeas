    "Title": "Self-Alignment for Multimodal Factuality: Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the self-alignment framework to multimodal settings, specifically vision-language models (VLMs). VLMs often generate textual outputs that are not grounded in the visual context, leading to hallucinations. We propose a self-alignment mechanism where the VLM evaluates the factuality of its textual outputs based on the visual input. The model is fine-tuned using a multimodal version of DPO, which incorporates both textual and visual signals. This approach ensures that the textual outputs are factually consistent with the visual context, reducing hallucinations in multimodal settings.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Define New Scientific Problems' theory (Kuhnâ€™s paradigm theory). The target paper focuses on text-only LLMs, but hallucinations are also a significant issue in multimodal models. By extending the self-alignment framework to VLMs, we can address a new and challenging problem in the field of multimodal AI.",
    "Rationale": "Multimodal models are increasingly being used in real-world applications, but their tendency to generate ungrounded textual outputs limits their reliability. By introducing a self-alignment mechanism for VLMs, we can improve the factuality of their outputs and make them more trustworthy. This could have a significant impact on applications such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and content moderation.",
