    "title": "Towards Within-Class Variation in Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Spontaneous Speech",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection has emerged as a promising research area that employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Unlike conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Given that many AD detection tasks lack fine-grained labels, simplistic binary classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class differences and instance-level imbalance. The former compels the model to map AD samples with varying degrees of impairment to a single diagnostic label, disregarding certain changes in cognitive function. While the latter biases the model towards overrepresented severity levels. This work presents early efforts to address these challenges. We propose two novel methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve detection accuracy. Further analysis reveals that SoTD effectively harnesses the strengths of multiple component models, while InRe substantially alleviates model over-fitting. These findings provide insights for developing more robust and reliable AD detection models."
