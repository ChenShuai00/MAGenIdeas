    "Title": "Multi-Modal Self-Alignment for Factual Consistency",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the concept of self-alignment to multi-modal settings, where the model is trained to align its textual outputs with visual or auditory inputs. The framework involves training the model to generate text that is consistent with the content of images, videos, or audio clips. The self-evaluation process is enhanced by incorporating multi-modal consistency checks, where the model evaluates the factual accuracy of its textual outputs by cross-referencing them with the corresponding visual or auditory inputs. This approach aims to reduce hallucinations in multi-modal applications, such as image captioning or video summarization, by ensuring that the model's outputs are factually consistent with the input data.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Define New Scientific Problems' theory (Kuhn’s paradigm theory) and 'Propose New Hypotheses' theory (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method). The target paper focuses on textual self-alignment, but LLMs are increasingly being used in multi-modal settings. By extending self-alignment to multi-modal contexts, we address a new and emerging problem in LLM research. The multi-modal consistency checks ensure that the model's outputs are not only self-consistent but also aligned with the input data.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that hallucinations in multi-modal settings can be particularly problematic, as they can lead to misleading or incorrect interpretations of visual or auditory content. By introducing multi-modal self-alignment, we address this issue and create models that are more reliable in multi-modal applications. This approach is particularly relevant for applications such as medical imaging or autonomous driving, where factual consistency is critical. The focus on multi-modal consistency ensures that the model's outputs are aligned with the input data, reducing the risk of hallucinations.",
