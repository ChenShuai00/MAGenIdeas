    "Title": "Self-Alignment for Robustness: Mitigating Hallucinations in LLMs via Multi-Task Self-Evaluation",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the self-alignment framework proposed in the target paper to address hallucinations across multiple tasks and domains. Instead of focusing solely on factuality, we introduce a multi-task self-evaluation mechanism where the LLM evaluates its outputs for factuality, fairness, and robustness simultaneously. The model is fine-tuned using a multi-objective version of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which balances these criteria. This approach not only improves factual accuracy but also ensures that the model generates outputs that are fair and robust to adversarial inputs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' theory (Laudanâ€™s methodological improvement model). The target paper focuses on factuality, but LLMs often exhibit other issues like bias and lack of robustness. By integrating multi-task self-evaluation, we can address these issues holistically, making the model more reliable for real-world applications.",
    "Rationale": "Current self-alignment methods are task-specific and do not generalize well across different domains. By introducing multi-task self-evaluation, we can create a more versatile and robust LLM. This approach aligns with the growing demand for trustworthy AI systems that perform well across diverse tasks and are resistant to adversarial attacks.",
