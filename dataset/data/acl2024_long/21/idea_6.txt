    "Title": "Dynamic Knowledge Adaptation for Self-Aligned Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a dynamic knowledge adaptation mechanism that allows LLMs to continuously update their internal knowledge base during inference. The mechanism identifies gaps or inconsistencies in the model's knowledge by comparing its self-evaluated responses with external knowledge sources. When discrepancies are detected, the model dynamically adapts its knowledge representation to align with the external evidence. This process is guided by a reinforcement learning framework that rewards the model for generating factually accurate responses and penalizes hallucinations. The goal is to create a self-improving system that becomes more factual over time without requiring extensive retraining.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on the 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' theory (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions) and 'Propose New Hypotheses' theory (Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving). The target paper focuses on static self-alignment, but LLMs operate in dynamic environments where new information constantly emerges. By introducing dynamic knowledge adaptation, we propose a paradigm shift in how LLMs handle knowledge updates. The reinforcement learning framework ensures that the model learns from its mistakes and improves its factuality over time.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that LLMs often fail to adapt to new or evolving information, leading to outdated or incorrect responses. By enabling dynamic knowledge adaptation, we address this limitation and create a model that can stay up-to-date with the latest information. This approach is particularly relevant for applications in rapidly changing domains, such as healthcare or finance, where factual accuracy is critical. The reinforcement learning framework ensures that the model's improvements are guided by factual correctness rather than superficial metrics.",
