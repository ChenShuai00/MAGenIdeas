    "title": "Bring dialogue-context into RNN-T for streaming ASR",
    "abstract": "Recently the conversational end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which directly integrate dialogue-context such as historical utterances into E2E models, have shown superior performance than single-utterance E2E models. However, few works investigate how to inject the dialogue-context into the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) model. In this work, we bring dialogue-context into a streaming RNN-T model and explore various structures of contextual RNN-T model as well as training strategies to better utilize the dialogue-context. Firstly, we propose a deep fusion architecture which efficiently integrates the dialogue-context within the encoder and predictor of RNN-T. Secondly, we propose contextual & non-contextual model joint training as regularization, and propose context perturbation to relieve the context mismatch between training and inference. Moreover, we adopt a context-aware language model (CLM) for contextual RNN-T decoding to take full advantage of the dialogue-context for conversational ASR. We conduct experiments on the Switchboard-2000h task and observe performance gains from the proposed techniques. Compared with non-contextual RNN-T, our contextual RNN-T model yields 4.8% / 6.0% relative improvement on Switchboard and Callhome Hub5\u201900 testsets. By additionally integrating a CLM, the gain is further increased to 10.6% / 7.8%."
