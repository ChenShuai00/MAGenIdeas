    "title": "The Origin of \"\u95ee\" as a Preposition",
    "abstract": "Prepositions in modern Chinese mostly originate from the process of verb functionalization and \"\u95ee\"makes no exception, which is founded on the typical Chinese sentence pattern \"a\u95eec\u66f0b\". Due to frequent and repeated employment of this structure, its semantic meaning gets generalized, which in turn begets the weakening of its verb nature and vanishing of its original meaning \"to question\",and as the pattern of \"a\u95eec\u66f0b\" transforms from the structure of \"predicative verb + predicative verb\" to the structure of \"adverbial + head verb\", it no longer designates any time information .and becomes a function word. Because of this transformation, there exist some restrictions on the predicative verb in a sentence containing the preposition\"\u95ee\". That is , only the three_valued and internalized verbs can force entrance into this sentence pattern. Nevertheless, its corresponding word \"\u7b54\" is spared the deviation for the simple reason that the word \"\u7b54\" presupposes a context in which a question emerges."
