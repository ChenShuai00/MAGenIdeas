    "title": "Word-Level Representation From Bytes For Language Modeling",
    "abstract": "Modern language models mostly take sub-words as input, a design that balances the trade-off between vocabulary size, number of parameters, and performance. However, sub-word tokenization still has disadvantages like not being robust to noise and difficult to generalize to new languages. Also, the current trend of scaling up models reveals that larger models require larger embeddings but that makes parallelization hard. Previous work on image classification proves splitting raw input into a sequence of chucks is a strong, model-agnostic inductive bias. Based on this observation, we rethink the existing character-aware method that takes character-level inputs but makes word-level sequence modeling and prediction. We overhaul this method by introducing a cross-attention network that builds word-level representation directly from bytes, and a sub-word level prediction based on word-level hidden states to avoid the time and space requirement of word-level prediction. With these two improvements combined, we have a token free model with slim input embeddings for downstream tasks. We name our method Byte2Word and perform evaluations on language modeling and text classification. Experiments show that Byte2Word is on par with the strong sub-word baseline BERT but only takes up 10\\% of embedding size. We further test our method on synthetic noise and cross-lingual transfer and find it competitive to baseline methods on both settings."
