    "title": "RetrievalSum: A Retrieval Enhanced Framework for Abstractive Summarization",
    "abstract": "Existing summarization systems mostly generate summaries purely relying on the content of the source document. However, even for humans, we usually need some references or exemplars to help us fully understand the source document and write summaries in a particular format. But how to find the high-quality exemplars and incorporate them into summarization systems is still challenging and worth exploring. In this paper, we propose RetrievalSum, a novel retrieval enhanced abstractive summarization framework consisting of a dense Retriever and a Summarizer. At first, several closely related exemplars are retrieved as supplementary input to help the generation model understand the text more comprehensively. Furthermore, retrieved exemplars can also play a role in guiding the model to capture the writing style of a specific corpus. We validate our method on a wide range of summarization datasets across multiple domains and two backbone models: BERT and BART. Results show that our framework obtains significant improvement by 1.38~4.66 in ROUGE-1 score when compared with the powerful pre-trained models, and achieve new state-of-the-art on BillSum. Human evaluation demonstrates that our retrieval enhanced model can better capture the domain-specific writing style."
