    "Title": "Concept-Level Adversarial Training for Robust Text Classification",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel adversarial training framework that targets spurious correlations at the concept level in language models. By generating adversarial examples that perturb conceptual features rather than surface-level tokens, the framework forces models to learn more robust representations. The approach integrates ChatGPT for concept labeling and counterfactual data generation, combined with adversarial training techniques to mitigate concept-level biases. The framework is evaluated on multiple text classification benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness to spurious correlations and better generalization to out-of-distribution data.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by 'Exploring the Limitations of Current Methods' (Popper’s falsificationism) and 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). Current adversarial training methods focus on token-level perturbations, which may not address deeper conceptual biases. By shifting the focus to concept-level perturbations, this approach challenges models to avoid relying on spurious correlations and learn more meaningful representations. The integration of ChatGPT for concept labeling and counterfactual data generation aligns with 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method), as it leverages analogical reasoning to create challenging adversarial examples.",
    "Rationale": "Spurious correlations at the concept level are a significant challenge in NLP, leading to poor model robustness and generalization. Existing adversarial training methods primarily focus on token-level perturbations, which may not fully address conceptual biases. By targeting concept-level features, this approach provides a more comprehensive solution to mitigate spurious correlations. The use of ChatGPT for concept labeling and counterfactual data generation ensures that the adversarial examples are semantically meaningful and challenging. This idea has the potential to significantly improve model robustness and generalization, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards.",
