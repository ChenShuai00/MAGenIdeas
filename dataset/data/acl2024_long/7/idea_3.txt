    "Title": "Concept-Level Interpretability for Detecting Spurious Correlations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a concept-level interpretability framework for detecting spurious correlations in language models. The approach uses ChatGPT to identify conceptual features in the input text and analyzes their influence on model predictions. By visualizing the contribution of each concept to the model’s decision, the framework helps researchers identify and mitigate spurious correlations. The method is evaluated on text classification and natural language inference tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving model interpretability and robustness.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by 'Exploring the Limitations of Current Methods' (Popper’s falsificationism) and 'Define New Scientific Problems' (Kuhn’s paradigm theory). Current interpretability methods often focus on token-level features, which may not capture deeper conceptual biases. By shifting the focus to concept-level interpretability, this approach provides a more comprehensive way to detect and mitigate spurious correlations. The use of ChatGPT for concept identification aligns with 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method), as it leverages creative reasoning to identify meaningful conceptual features.",
    "Rationale": "Interpretability is crucial for understanding and improving the robustness of language models. However, existing methods often fail to capture conceptual biases, which can lead to spurious correlations. This idea addresses this gap by introducing a concept-level interpretability framework, which provides deeper insights into model behavior. The approach has broad applicability across NLP tasks and has the potential to significantly improve model robustness and transparency, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards.",
