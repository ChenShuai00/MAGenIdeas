    "Title": "Dynamic Concept Balancing: A Data-Centric Approach to Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a dynamic data rebalancing technique that continuously adjusts the distribution of concept-label pairs during training to mitigate spurious correlations. The approach leverages ChatGPT to identify and label concepts in the training data, then dynamically generates counterfactual examples to balance the representation of each concept across labels. A reinforcement learning framework is used to optimize the rebalancing process, ensuring that the model is exposed to a diverse and balanced set of concept-label associations. This method aims to reduce the reliance on shortcuts and improve generalization across different datasets and tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which focuses on improving existing methodologies. The dynamic rebalancing approach is inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**, as it involves iterative optimization and adaptation. The use of reinforcement learning aligns with **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, as it involves creating and testing hypotheses about the optimal data distribution. The integration of ChatGPT for concept labeling builds on the target paper’s contributions, extending them to a dynamic and adaptive framework.",
    "Rationale": "Imbalanced concept-label distributions are a major source of spurious correlations in language models. Traditional data rebalancing techniques are static and often fail to address the dynamic nature of training. By introducing a dynamic and adaptive rebalancing approach, this idea addresses a critical limitation in existing methods. The use of reinforcement learning ensures that the rebalancing process is optimized for the specific task and dataset, leading to improved model robustness. This approach has broad applicability across NLP tasks and is highly relevant to top conferences like ICLR and CVPR.",
