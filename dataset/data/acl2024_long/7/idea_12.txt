    "Title": "Conceptual Explainability: Uncovering and Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Language Models via Interpretable Concept Representations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework for enhancing the interpretability of language models by explicitly representing and analyzing concepts in the input text. The approach uses ChatGPT to generate concept-level explanations for model predictions, enabling the identification of spurious concept-label correlations. A novel interpretability module is introduced to quantify the contribution of each concept to the model’s decision-making process. Based on this analysis, the framework applies targeted debiasing techniques to mitigate spurious correlations, such as concept-specific regularization or adversarial training. This method aims to improve both the robustness and interpretability of language models.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing anomalies in existing theories. The focus on interpretability aligns with **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, as it involves improving the transparency and reliability of methodologies. The use of ChatGPT for concept-level explanations builds on the target paper’s approach, extending it to interpretability and debiasing. The integration of adversarial training and regularization techniques is informed by **Popper’s falsificationism**, as it involves critically analyzing and refining existing methods.",
    "Rationale": "Interpretability is a key challenge in NLP, particularly in the context of spurious correlations. By explicitly representing and analyzing concepts, this idea addresses a critical gap in the literature. The proposed framework not only improves model robustness but also enhances transparency, making it easier to diagnose and mitigate biases. This approach has broad applicability across NLP tasks and is highly relevant to top conferences like ACL and NeurIPS, where interpretability and robustness are key areas of interest.",
