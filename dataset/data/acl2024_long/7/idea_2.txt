    "Title": "Concept-Aware Data Augmentation for Mitigating Spurious Correlations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a concept-aware data augmentation technique to mitigate spurious correlations in language models. The approach uses ChatGPT to generate counterfactual examples that alter conceptual features while preserving the semantic meaning of the text. By augmenting the training data with these counterfactual examples, the method encourages models to learn more robust representations that are less reliant on spurious correlations. The technique is evaluated on text classification and natural language inference tasks, demonstrating improved robustness and generalization.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) and 'Propose New Hypotheses' (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method). Current data augmentation techniques often focus on surface-level perturbations, which may not address deeper conceptual biases. By generating counterfactual examples that alter conceptual features, this approach provides a more effective way to mitigate spurious correlations. The use of ChatGPT for counterfactual generation aligns with 'Propose New Hypotheses', as it leverages creative reasoning to create meaningful augmentations.",
    "Rationale": "Spurious correlations are a major challenge in NLP, leading to poor model robustness and generalization. Data augmentation is a common technique to address this issue, but existing methods often fail to target conceptual biases. This idea addresses this gap by introducing concept-aware data augmentation, which generates counterfactual examples that challenge models to avoid relying on spurious correlations. The approach has broad applicability across NLP tasks and has the potential to significantly improve model robustness, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards.",
