    "title": "The Nature of NLP: Analyzing Contributions in NLP Papers",
    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a dynamic, interdisciplinary field that integrates intellectual traditions from computer science, linguistics, social science, and more. Despite its established presence, the definition of what constitutes NLP research remains debated. In this work, we quantitatively investigate what constitutes NLP by examining research papers. For this purpose, we propose a taxonomy and introduce NLPContributions, a dataset of nearly $2k$ research paper abstracts, expertly annotated to identify scientific contributions and classify their types according to this taxonomy. We also propose a novel task to automatically identify these elements, for which we train a strong baseline on our dataset. We present experimental results from this task and apply our model to $\\sim$$29k$ NLP research papers to analyze their contributions, aiding in the understanding of the nature of NLP research. Our findings reveal a rising involvement of machine learning in NLP since the early nineties, alongside a declining focus on adding knowledge about language or people; again, in post-2020, there has been a resurgence of focus on language and people. We hope this work will spark discussions on our community norms and inspire efforts to consciously shape the future."
