    "title": "Finding Good Answers in Online Forums: Community Question Answering for Bulgarian",
    "abstract": "Community Question Answering (CQA) is a form of question answering that is getting increasingly popular as a research direction recently. Given a question posted in an online community forum and the thread of answers to it, a common formulation of the task is to rank automatically the answers, so that the good ones are ranked higher than the bad ones. Despite the vast research in CQA for English, very little attention has been paid to other languages. To bridge this gap, here we present our method for Community Question Answering in Bulgarian. We create annotated training and testing datasets for Bulgarian, and we further explore the applicability of machine translation for reusing English CQA data for building a Bulgarian system. The evaluation results show improvement over the baseline and can serve as a basis for further research."
