    "title": "On a Novel Application of Wasserstein-Procrustes for Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Alignment of Embeddings",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised word embeddings, pre-trained on vast monolingual text corpora, have driven the neural revolution in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initially developed for English, these embeddings soon expanded to other languages, spurring efforts to align embedding spaces for cross-lingual NLP applications. Unsupervised cross-lingual alignment of embeddings (UCAE) is particularly appealing due to its minimal data requirements and competitive performance against supervised and semi-supervised approaches. In this work, we scrutinize prevalent UCAE methods and discover their objectives inherently resemble the Wasserstein-Procrustes problem. Consequently, we propose a direct solution for Wasserstein-Procrustes, enhancing popular UCAE techniques such as iterative closest point (ICP), multilingual unsupervised and supervised embeddings (MUSE), and supervised Procrustes methods. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates significant improvements over existing approaches. Our reexamination of the Wasserstein-Procrustes problem fosters further research, paving the way for more effective algorithms to align word embeddings across languages."
