    "title": "Fact-Checking, Fake News, Propaganda, Media Bias, and the COVID-19 Infodemic",
    "abstract": "Social media have democratized content creation and have made it easy for anybody to spread information online. However, stripping traditional media from their gate-keeping role has left the public unprotected against biased, deceptive and disinformative content, which could now travel online at breaking-news speed and influence major public events. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a new blending of medical and political disinformation has given rise to the first global infodemic. We offer an overview of the emerging and inter-connected research areas of fact-checking, disinformation, \"fake news'', propaganda, and media bias detection. We explore the general fact-checking pipeline and important elements thereof such as check-worthiness estimation, spotting previously fact-checked claims, stance detection, source reliability estimation, detection of persuasion techniques, and detecting malicious users in social media. We also cover large-scale pre-trained language models, and the challenges and opportunities they offer for generating and for defending against neural fake news. Finally, we discuss the ongoing COVID-19 infodemic."
