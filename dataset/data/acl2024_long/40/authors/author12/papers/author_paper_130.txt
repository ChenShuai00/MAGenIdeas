    "abstract": "Online hate speech and offensive comments de-001 tection is not a trivial research problem since 002 pragmatic (contextual) factors influence what 003 is considered offensive. Moreover, offensive 004 terms are hardly found in classical lexical re-005 sources such as wordnets, sentiment, and emo-006 tion lexicons. In this paper, we embrace the 007 challenges and opportunities of the area and in-008 troduce the first multilingual offensive lexicon 009 (MOL), which is composed of 1,000 explicit 010 and implicit pejorative terms and expressions 011 annotated with contextual information. The 012 terms and expressions were manually extracted 013 by a specialist from Instagram abusive com-014 ments originally written in Portuguese and man-015 ually translated by American English, Latin 016 American Spanish, African French, and Ger-017 man native speakers. Each expression was an-018 notated by three different annotators, producing 019 high human inter-annotator agreement. Accord-020 ingly, this resource provides a new perspective 021 to explore abusive language detection. 022"
