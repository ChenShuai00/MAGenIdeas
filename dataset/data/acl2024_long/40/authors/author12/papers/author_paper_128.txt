    "title": "Overview of the CLEF-2021 CheckThat! Lab Task 2 on Detecting Previously Fact-Checked Claims in Tweets and Political Debates",
    "abstract": "We describe the fourth edition of the CheckThat! Lab, part of the 2021 Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF). The lab evaluates technology supporting three tasks related to factuality, and it covers Arabic, Bulgarian, English, Spanish, and Turkish. Here, we present the task 2, which asks to detect previously fact-checked claims (in two languages). A total of four teams participated in this task, submitted a total of sixteen runs, and most submissions managed to achieve sizable improvements over the baselines using transformer based models such as BERT, RoBERTa. In this paper, we describe the process of data collection and the task setup, including the evaluation measures used, and we give a brief overview of the participating systems. Last but not least, we release to the research community all datasets from the lab as well as the evaluation scripts, which should enable further research in detecting previously fact-checked claims. \u00a9 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
