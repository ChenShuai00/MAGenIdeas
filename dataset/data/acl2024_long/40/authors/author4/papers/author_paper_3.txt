    "title": "Hands-On Tutorial: Labeling with LLM and Human-in-the-Loop",
    "abstract": "Training and deploying machine learning models relies on a large amount of human-annotated data. As human labeling becomes increasingly expensive and time-consuming, recent research has developed multiple strategies to speed up annotation and reduce costs and human workload: generating synthetic training data, active learning, and hybrid labeling. This tutorial is oriented toward practical applications: we will present the basics of each strategy, highlight their benefits and limitations, and discuss in detail real-life case studies. Additionally, we will walk through best practices for managing human annotators and controlling the quality of the final dataset. The tutorial includes a hands-on workshop, where attendees will be guided in implementing a hybrid annotation setup. This tutorial is designed for NLP practitioners from both research and industry backgrounds who are involved in or interested in optimizing data labeling projects."
