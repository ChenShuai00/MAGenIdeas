    "title": "NIX-TTS: Lightweight and End-to-End Text-to-Speech Via Module-Wise Distillation",
    "abstract": "Several solutions for lightweight TTS have shown promising results. Still, they either rely on a hand-crafted design that reaches non-optimum size or use a neural architecture search but often suffer training costs. We present Nix- TTS, a lightweight TTS achieved via knowledge distillation to a high-quality yet large-sized, non-autoregressive, and end-to-end (vocoder-free) TTS teacher model. Specifically, we offer module-wise distillation, enabling flexible and independent distillation to the encoder and decoder module. The resulting Nix - TTS inherited the advantageous properties of being non-autoregressive and end-to-end from the teacher, yet significantly smaller in size, with only 5.23M parameters or up to 89.34% reduction of the teacher model; it also achieves over 3.04x and 8.36x inference speedup on Intel-i7 CPU and Raspberry Pi 3B respectively and still retains a fair voice naturalness and intelligibility compared to the teacher model. We provide pretrained models and audio samples of Nix-TTS11https://github.com/rendchevi/nix-tts."
