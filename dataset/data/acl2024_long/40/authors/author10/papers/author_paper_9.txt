    "title": "Data Augmentation Techniques for Machine Translation of Code-Switched Texts: A Comparative Study",
    "abstract": "Code-switching (CSW) text generation has been receiving increasing attention as a solution to address data scarcity. In light of this growing interest, we need more comprehensive studies comparing different augmentation approaches. In this work, we compare three popular approaches: lexical replacements, linguistic theories, and back-translation (BT), in the context of Egyptian Arabic-English CSW. We assess the effectiveness of the approaches on machine translation and the quality of augmentations through human evaluation. We show that BT and CSW predictive-based lexical replacement, being trained on CSW parallel data, perform best on both tasks. Linguistic theories and random lexical replacement prove to be effective in the lack of CSW parallel data, where both approaches achieve similar results."
