    "title": "HelloThere: A Corpus of Annotated Dialogues and Knowledge Bases of Time-Offset Avatars",
    "abstract": "A Time-Offset Interaction Application (TOIA) is a software system that allows people to engage in face-to-face dialogue with previously recorded videos of other people. There are two TOIA usage modes: (a) creation mode, where users pre-record video snippets of themselves representing their answers to possible questions someone may ask them, and (b) interaction mode, where other users of the system can choose to interact with created avatars. This paper presents the HelloThere corpus that has been collected from two user studies involving several people who recorded avatars and many more who engaged in dialogues with them. The interactions with avatars are annotated by people asking them questions through three modes (card selection, text search, and voice input) and rating the appropriateness of their answers on a 1 to 5 scale. The corpus, made available to the research community, comprises 26 avatars\u2019 knowledge bases and 317 dialogues between 64 interrogators and the avatars in text format."
