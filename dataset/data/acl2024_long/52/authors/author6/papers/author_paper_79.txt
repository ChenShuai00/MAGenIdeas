    "abstract": "Fact veri\ufb01cation is the task to verify a given 001 claim according to extracted evidence sen-002 tences. Most existing works use whole ev-003 idence sentences or break them into phrases 004 to perform evidence interaction, where evi-005 dence is treated either too coarsely or over 006 fragmented. We also \ufb01nd that many models 007 suffer from exposure bias, which \ufb01nally leads 008 to them only paying attention to the evidence 009 ranked higher by previous steps while failing 010 to recognize crucial pieces from all candidates. 011 In this paper, we propose an Evidence Decom-012 position Graph Network (EDGN), which de-013 composes each evidence sentence, especially 014 the complex ones, into several simple sen-015 tences, highlighting the required key infor-016 mation without losing sentence structure and 017 meaning. EDGN also absorbs a simple but ef-018 fective evidence shuf\ufb02ing method to mitigate 019 exposure bias. Experiments on the FEVER 020 benchmark show our model can take all ev-021 idence candidates into account, distill neces-022 sary key information from complex evidence, 023 and outperform existing methods in the litera-024 ture. We will release our code to the commu-025 nity for further exploration. 026"
