    "abstract": "An increasing number of advancements have 001 been accomplished in agents empowered by 002 Large Language Models (LLM), particularly 003 in resolving simple dialogue tasks. However, 004 existing agents still face intractable robustness 005 issues for solving complex tasks, encounter-006 ing the cascading hallucinations induced by 007 multi-step invocations of LLM. Certain recent 008 studies utilize multi-step reasoning, planning 009 strategies, and domain workflows to improve 010 the success rate of complex tasks, yet they ne-011 glect the scientific methodology that encom-012 passes the accumulated wisdom derived from 013 centuries of scientific inquiry. Drawing inspi-014 ration from the scientific methodology, we pro-015 pose the S-Agent - an agent collaborative frame-016 work meticulously designed to actively exper-017 iment and refine theories based on the analy-018 sis of experimental results, thereby enhancing 019 the deductive capabilities of LLMs and com-020 plementing their inductive and communicative 021 strengths. Additionally, we introduce an inno-022 vative parallel planning methodology, wherein 023 agents with identical roles collaborate to simul-024 taneously address the same inquiry. Extensive 025 experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and 026 efficiency of our approach. Notably, we achieve 027 a new state-of-the-art 33 . 3% pass@1 accuracy 028 on the LeetcodeHardGym coding benchmark 029 and a relatively good 96 . 3% pass@1 on Hu-030 manEval with GPT-4. 031"
