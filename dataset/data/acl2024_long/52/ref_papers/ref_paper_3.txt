    "title": "MetaAgents: Simulating Interactions of Human Behaviors for LLM-based Task-oriented Coordination via Collaborative Generative Agents",
    "abstract": "Significant advancements have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks and social simulations. Despite this, their capacities to coordinate within task-oriented social contexts are under-explored. Such capabilities are crucial if LLMs are to effectively mimic human-like social behavior and produce meaningful results. To bridge this gap, we introduce collaborative generative agents, endowing LLM-based Agents with consistent behavior patterns and task-solving abilities. We situate these agents in a simulated job fair environment as a case study to scrutinize their coordination skills. We propose a novel framework that equips collaborative generative agents with human-like reasoning abilities and specialized skills. Our evaluation demonstrates that these agents show promising performance. However, we also uncover limitations that hinder their effectiveness in more complex coordination tasks. Our work provides valuable insights into the role and evolution of LLMs in task-oriented social simulations."
