    "Title": "Contrastive Hallucination Detection (CHD): A Training-Free Approach for Mitigating Hallucinations in MLLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes Contrastive Hallucination Detection (CHD), a training-free approach for mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. CHD uses contrastive learning to compare the model’s generated outputs with a set of reference outputs that are known to be hallucination-free. The approach identifies hallucinated outputs by measuring their divergence from the reference outputs and applies a contrastive penalty to reduce hallucinations. CHD is designed to be modular and can be integrated into existing MLLMs without requiring additional training. The approach is evaluated on a diverse set of multimodal tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and document understanding.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Popper’s falsificationism** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. Popper’s falsificationism is used to critically evaluate the limitations of current hallucination detection methods, which often require extensive training. Laudan’s methodological improvement model is applied to design a training-free approach that leverages contrastive learning to mitigate hallucinations. The idea also draws on **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** to propose that contrastive learning can be used to identify and reduce hallucinations in MLLMs.",
    "Rationale": "Current hallucination detection methods often require extensive training, which limits their scalability and applicability. CHD addresses this gap by introducing a training-free approach that uses contrastive learning to mitigate hallucinations. The approach is modular, scalable, and can be integrated into existing MLLMs without requiring additional training. This makes it a practical and effective solution for reducing hallucinations in real-world applications.",
