    "Title": "Hallucination-Aware Multimodal Fusion: A Novel Framework for Robust Multimodal Large Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hallucination-aware multimodal fusion framework that dynamically adjusts the contribution of each modality (text, image, audio) based on its likelihood of causing hallucinations. The framework uses a probabilistic model to estimate the reliability of each modality and adjusts the fusion weights accordingly. For example, if the text modality is found to be more prone to hallucinations in a given context, its contribution to the final output is reduced, while the contributions of more reliable modalities are increased. The framework also includes a feedback mechanism that continuously updates the reliability estimates based on the model's performance, ensuring that the fusion process adapts to new data and contexts.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions**. The methodological improvement comes from enhancing the multimodal fusion process by incorporating hallucination-aware mechanisms, which improve the robustness of MLLMs. The paradigm shift is reflected in the move from static fusion methods to dynamic, context-aware fusion that adapts to the reliability of different modalities. The hypothesis is that by dynamically adjusting the contribution of each modality based on its likelihood of causing hallucinations, the framework can significantly reduce the occurrence of hallucinations in MLLMs.",
    "Rationale": "Current multimodal fusion methods in MLLMs often treat all modalities equally, without considering their individual reliability or propensity to cause hallucinations. This idea addresses this limitation by introducing a hallucination-aware fusion framework that dynamically adjusts the contribution of each modality based on its reliability. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce hallucinations in MLLMs, making them more robust and reliable in real-world applications. The dynamic nature of the framework also ensures that it can adapt to new data and contexts, making it suitable for deployment in dynamic environments.",
