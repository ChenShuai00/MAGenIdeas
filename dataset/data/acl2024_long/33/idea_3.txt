    "Title": "Self-Supervised Hallucination Detection: Leveraging Unlabeled Data for Robust Multimodal Large Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a self-supervised learning approach for hallucination detection in MLLMs, where the model learns to detect hallucinations by training on large amounts of unlabeled multimodal data. The approach involves creating synthetic hallucinated examples by perturbing the input data and training the model to distinguish between real and hallucinated outputs. The self-supervised learning framework allows the model to learn robust representations of hallucinations without the need for extensive labeled data, making it more scalable and applicable to a wide range of tasks. The framework also includes a feedback loop that continuously refines the detection process based on the model's performance, ensuring that it adapts to new types of hallucinations over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings**. The methodological improvement comes from leveraging self-supervised learning to improve hallucination detection, while the theory of anomalous findings is used to identify and explain the patterns of hallucinations in the data. The hypothesis is that self-supervised learning can provide a scalable and effective approach to hallucination detection, especially in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. By training on large amounts of unlabeled data, the model can learn robust representations of hallucinations, making it more effective at detecting them in real-world applications.",
    "Rationale": "Current methods for hallucination detection in MLLMs often rely on labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This idea addresses this limitation by proposing a self-supervised learning approach that leverages unlabeled data to train the model to detect hallucinations. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the scalability and applicability of hallucination detection methods, making them more suitable for real-world applications. The self-supervised learning framework also ensures that the model can adapt to new types of hallucinations over time, making it more robust and effective in dynamic environments.",
