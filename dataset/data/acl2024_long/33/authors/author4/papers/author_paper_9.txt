    "title": "Making Large Language Models Better Knowledge Miners for Online Marketing with Progressive Prompting Augmentation",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, the rapid development of mobile economy has promoted the flourishing of online marketing campaigns, whose success greatly hinges on the efficient matching between user preferences and desired marketing campaigns where a well-established Marketing-oriented Knowledge Graph (dubbed as MoKG) could serve as the critical\"bridge\"for preference propagation. In this paper, we seek to carefully prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with domain-level knowledge as a better marketing-oriented knowledge miner for marketing-oriented knowledge graph construction, which is however non-trivial, suffering from several inevitable issues in real-world marketing scenarios, i.e., uncontrollable relation generation of LLMs,insufficient prompting ability of a single prompt, the unaffordable deployment cost of LLMs. To this end, we propose PAIR, a novel Progressive prompting Augmented mIning fRamework for harvesting marketing-oriented knowledge graph with LLMs. In particular, we reduce the pure relation generation to an LLM based adaptive relation filtering process through the knowledge-empowered prompting technique. Next, we steer LLMs for entity expansion with progressive prompting augmentation,followed by a reliable aggregation with comprehensive consideration of both self-consistency and semantic relatedness. In terms of online serving, we specialize in a small and white-box PAIR (i.e.,LightPAIR),which is fine-tuned with a high-quality corpus provided by a strong teacher-LLM. Extensive experiments and practical applications in audience targeting verify the effectiveness of the proposed (Light)PAIR."
