    "title": "Intent Mining: A Social and Semantic Enhanced Topic Model for Operation-Friendly Digital Marketing",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the digital marketing where marketing officers (MOs) have to commit to creating brand new promotion ads/contents based on understandings of users' needs or preferences. Users' behaviors are typically high dimensional and hard to understand. Therefore, dimension reduction of users' behaviors from high dimensions and explainability are important to help MOs launch operation-friendly marketings. As such, it is natural to exploit topic models to help MOs understand users' intents from users' behaviors (e.g., user-item visits) in case we treat each user as a document and users' behaviors of visiting an item as a word. However, users of low activities and items followed by power law distributions are common in user-item visit data, which pose significant challenges to traditional topic models. We present a social and semantic enhanced topic model (S2TM) for users' intent mining. We optimize the user-intent estimates based on a graph neural network atop of a social network, and optimize the intent-item estimates based on a skip-gram word embedding approach by linking the semantics of items to pre-trained word embeddings. We propose an efficient stochastic vari-ational inference algorithm for the inference of latent variables and learning of parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world data show the effectivenesses of S2TM in terms of perplexities, topic coherence and semantic coherence compared with state-of-the-art topic models. We further show how MOs interact with our operation-friendly intent mining system, and results on real-world marketing campaigns in terms of click-through rate at Alipay."
