    "Title": "Multimodal Contrastive Learning for Hallucination Reduction",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel training framework that uses multimodal contrastive learning to reduce hallucinations in MLLMs. The framework would train the model to align textual and visual representations more closely, reducing the likelihood of generating inconsistent or hallucinated content. The contrastive learning objective would be designed to penalize discrepancies between textual and visual information, improving the model’s ability to generate accurate and consistent outputs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions, which emphasizes the importance of paradigm shifts in scientific discovery. By redefining the problem of hallucination as a misalignment between modalities, we can develop a new approach to reducing hallucinations through contrastive learning.",
    "Rationale": "Current methods for hallucination detection often treat textual and visual information separately, leading to inconsistencies and hallucinations. By using contrastive learning to align these modalities, we can reduce the likelihood of hallucinations and improve the overall accuracy of MLLMs. This approach is particularly relevant for applications like visual storytelling or multimodal dialogue systems, where consistency between modalities is critical.",
