    "Title": "Hallucination-Aware Multimodal Fusion (HAMF): Enhancing MLLMs with Contextual Consistency",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces Hallucination-Aware Multimodal Fusion (HAMF), a novel approach for enhancing MLLMs by ensuring contextual consistency across multimodal inputs. HAMF uses a hierarchical fusion mechanism that integrates text, image, and video inputs while explicitly modeling their relationships to minimize hallucinations. The approach includes a hallucination-aware attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the importance of different modalities based on their consistency with the input context. HAMF also incorporates a hallucination penalty term in the loss function, which penalizes the model for generating outputs that are inconsistent with the input context. The approach is evaluated on a diverse set of multimodal tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and document understanding.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** and **Laudan’s problem-solving model**. Kuhn’s paradigm theory is used to identify the limitations of current multimodal fusion methods, which often fail to explicitly model contextual consistency. Laudan’s problem-solving model is applied to design a solution that enhances MLLMs by ensuring contextual consistency across multimodal inputs. The idea also leverages **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** to propose that a hallucination-aware attention mechanism can significantly reduce hallucinations in MLLMs.",
    "Rationale": "Current multimodal fusion methods often fail to explicitly model contextual consistency, leading to hallucinations in MLLMs. HAMF addresses this gap by introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that ensures contextual consistency across multimodal inputs. The hallucination-aware attention mechanism dynamically adjusts the importance of different modalities based on their consistency with the input context, thereby reducing hallucinations. This approach is novel, scalable, and has the potential to significantly improve the reliability of MLLMs in real-world applications.",
