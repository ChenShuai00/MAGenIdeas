    "Title": "Explainable Hallucination Detection: A Framework for Interpretable Multimodal Large Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes an explainable hallucination detection framework that provides interpretable explanations for why a particular output is flagged as a hallucination. The framework uses a combination of attention mechanisms, saliency maps, and natural language explanations to provide insights into the decision-making process of the hallucination detection model. The explanations are designed to be understandable by both experts and non-experts, making the framework suitable for deployment in real-world applications where transparency and interpretability are critical. The framework also includes a feedback mechanism that allows users to provide feedback on the explanations, which is used to refine the detection process over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. The theory of anomalous findings is used to identify and explain the patterns of hallucinations, while the methodological improvement comes from enhancing the interpretability of the hallucination detection process. The hypothesis is that by providing interpretable explanations for hallucination detection, the framework can improve the transparency and trustworthiness of MLLMs, making them more suitable for deployment in real-world applications. The feedback mechanism ensures that the explanations are continuously refined based on user feedback, making the framework more effective over time.",
    "Rationale": "Current hallucination detection methods in MLLMs often lack transparency, making it difficult for users to understand why a particular output is flagged as a hallucination. This idea addresses this limitation by proposing an explainable hallucination detection framework that provides interpretable explanations for the detection process. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the transparency and trustworthiness of MLLMs, making them more suitable for deployment in real-world applications where interpretability is critical. The feedback mechanism also ensures that the explanations are continuously refined based on user feedback, making the framework more effective over time.",
