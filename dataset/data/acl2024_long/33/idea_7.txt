    "Title": "Retrieval-Augmented Hallucination Detection for Multimodal Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes enhancing the UNIHD framework by integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. The framework would use external knowledge bases to validate the factual consistency of generated content, reducing hallucinations. The retrieval mechanism would be fine-tuned to prioritize multimodal data, ensuring that both textual and visual information are validated against external sources.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Laudan’s methodological improvement model and Hacking’s experimental system theory. By integrating retrieval-augmented generation, we can improve the accuracy and robustness of hallucination detection, leveraging external knowledge to validate the model’s outputs.",
    "Rationale": "Retrieval-augmented generation has shown promise in improving the factual accuracy of language models. By extending this approach to multimodal models, we can address hallucinations that arise from inconsistencies between textual and visual information. This approach is particularly relevant for applications like medical imaging or autonomous driving, where factual accuracy is critical.",
