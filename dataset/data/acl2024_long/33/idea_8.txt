    "Title": "Fine-Grained Hallucination Classification in Multimodal Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a fine-grained classification framework for hallucinations in MLLMs, categorizing them into types such as object-level, attribute-level, and relation-level hallucinations. The framework would use a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning to train the model to detect and classify different types of hallucinations, improving the granularity and accuracy of hallucination detection.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Kuhnâ€™s theory of crises and revolutions, which emphasizes the importance of re-examining existing problems and developing new frameworks to address them. By classifying hallucinations into fine-grained categories, we can develop more targeted solutions for each type, leading to a more comprehensive hallucination detection system.",
    "Rationale": "Current hallucination detection methods treat all hallucinations as a single category, which limits their effectiveness. By classifying hallucinations into fine-grained types, we can develop more precise detection mechanisms, improving the overall reliability of MLLMs. This approach is particularly relevant for applications like image captioning or visual question answering, where different types of hallucinations require different detection strategies.",
