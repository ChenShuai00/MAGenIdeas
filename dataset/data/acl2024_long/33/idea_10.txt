    "Title": "Dynamic Contextual Hallucination Detection (DCHD): A Real-Time Framework for Multimodal Large Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a real-time hallucination detection framework, DCHD, that dynamically adapts to the context of multimodal inputs (text, images, and videos) by leveraging a combination of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and contrastive learning. DCHD integrates a lightweight, trainable module into MLLMs that continuously monitors the consistency between generated outputs and the input context. It uses a novel contrastive loss function to penalize hallucinated outputs by comparing them with retrieved factual evidence from external knowledge bases. The framework also includes a feedback loop that allows the model to iteratively refine its outputs based on detected inconsistencies. DCHD is designed to be modular, enabling seamless integration into existing MLLMs without significant computational overhead.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**. The methodological improvement model is used to design a new framework that enhances existing hallucination detection methods by integrating retrieval-augmented generation and contrastive learning. The hypothetical deduction method is applied to propose a novel hypothesis: that real-time, context-aware hallucination detection can significantly improve the reliability of MLLMs. The idea also draws on **Popper’s falsificationism** to critically evaluate the limitations of current hallucination detection methods, such as their inability to dynamically adapt to multimodal contexts.",
    "Rationale": "Current hallucination detection methods are often static and fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of multimodal inputs. DCHD addresses this gap by introducing a real-time, context-aware framework that leverages external knowledge and contrastive learning to detect and mitigate hallucinations. The integration of retrieval-augmented generation ensures that the model is grounded in factual evidence, while the contrastive loss function penalizes inconsistencies. This approach is novel, scalable, and has the potential to significantly improve the reliability of MLLMs in real-world applications.",
