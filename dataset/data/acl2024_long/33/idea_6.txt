    "Title": "Simulated Hallucination Training for Robust Multimodal Models",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a novel training paradigm where MLLMs are exposed to simulated hallucination scenarios during training. By generating controlled hallucination instances and training the model to detect and correct them, the model becomes more robust to real-world hallucinations. The framework leverages diffusion models to generate realistic hallucination scenarios and uses contrastive learning to distinguish between accurate and hallucinated content.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method and Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving. By simulating hallucination scenarios, we can create a controlled environment to test and improve the model’s ability to detect hallucinations, leading to more robust and reliable MLLMs.",
    "Rationale": "Current training methods do not explicitly address hallucination detection, leading to models that are prone to generating inaccurate content. By simulating hallucinations during training, the model can learn to identify and correct these errors, resulting in improved performance in real-world applications. This approach also aligns with the trend of using synthetic data to enhance model robustness.",
