    "title": "Attending to Emotional Narratives",
    "abstract": "Attention mechanisms in deep neural networks have achieved excellent performance on sequence-prediction tasks. Here, we show that these recently-proposed attention-based mechanisms-in particular, the Transformer with its parallelizable self-attention layers, and the Memory Fusion Network with attention across modalities and time-also generalize well to multimodal time-series emotion recognition. Using a recently-introduced dataset of emotional autobiographical narratives, we adapt and apply these two attention mechanisms to predict emotional valence over time. Our models perform extremely well, in some cases reaching a performance comparable with human raters. We end with a discussion of the implications of attention mechanisms to affective computing."
