    "Title": "Dynamic Intent-Aware Defense: A Multimodal Framework for Real-Time Jailbreak Detection in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This research proposes a dynamic intent-aware defense framework for LLMs that leverages multimodal cues (e.g., linguistic patterns, contextual tone, user interaction history) to detect and mitigate jailbreaking attempts in real-time. Unlike static rule-based defenses, this framework dynamically evaluates the intent behind user inputs, distinguishing between genuine queries and adversarial persuasion. The framework integrates: (1) a multimodal intent classifier trained on persuasive tactics, jailbreak patterns, and benign interactions; (2) a context-aware reinforcement learning module that adapts defense strategies based on interaction history; and (3) a real-time feedback loop that updates the model’s safety parameters during deployment. The approach will be evaluated against state-of-the-art jailbreaking methods (e.g., adversarial suffixes, cipher attacks, persona modulation) across multiple LLMs (GPT-4, LLaMA-2, Claude). Metrics include jailbreak success rate reduction, false positive rate, and computational overhead.",
    "Thinking": "The idea stems from Kuhn’s paradigm theory, which highlights the anomaly that LLMs remain vulnerable despite alignment efforts, suggesting a need for a paradigm shift in safety mechanisms. Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method is used to propose that dynamic intent evaluation can address this gap. The framework is inspired by Feyerabend’s methodological anarchism, combining diverse techniques (NLP, psychology, reinforcement learning) for robust solutions. The novelty lies in its proactive, context-sensitive approach, diverging from reactive rule-based defenses.",
    "Rationale": "Current defenses (e.g., perplexity filters, alignment tuning) are brittle and fail against adaptive attacks like persuasion or ciphers. By modeling intent dynamically, this framework addresses the root cause: LLMs’ lack of contextual understanding. The multimodal approach ensures robustness across attack vectors, while the feedback loop enables continuous improvement. This work bridges AI safety with human-computer interaction, offering a scalable solution with empirical validation, making it a strong candidate for top-tier conferences."
