    "Title": "Dynamic Intent-Aware Safeguards for LLMs: A Multi-Modal Feedback Approach to Prevent Persuasion and Jailbreaking Attacks",
    "Idea": "This research proposes a novel framework for LLM safety that dynamically analyzes user intent in real-time using multi-modal feedback (text, tone, context, and user history) to prevent persuasion-based jailbreaking and other adversarial attacks. The system would: (1) Detect subtle persuasion patterns (e.g., flattery, authority appeals) using a fine-tuned intent classifier; (2) Cross-validate intent against multi-modal cues (e.g., sentiment, linguistic markers); (3) Deploy context-aware countermeasures (e.g., rephrasing queries, seeking clarification, or refusing harmful requests). The framework would be trained on a diverse dataset of adversarial interactions, including persuasion attempts, cipher attacks, and low-resource language exploits, to generalize across attack vectors. The key innovation is moving beyond static safety rules to a dynamic system that adapts to emerging threats by understanding the underlying intent behind queries.",
    "Thinking": "The idea stems from Kuhn’s paradigm theory (identifying the anomaly that static alignment fails against dynamic attacks) and Pierce’s hypothetical deduction (proposing intent-aware systems as a solution). It also draws from Laudan’s methodological improvement model by integrating new technologies (multi-modal analysis) to improve safety. The thinking process involved: (1) Observing that current defenses (e.g., perplexity filters, alignment) are reactive and brittle; (2) Hypothesizing that intent analysis could preempt attacks; (3) Validating the gap via referenced papers (e.g., cipher attacks bypass natural-language defenses); (4) Proposing a holistic solution combining intent detection and multi-modal feedback.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale is threefold: (1) Current LLM safety is fragmented (e.g., defenses against ciphers don’t stop persuasion), whereas intent analysis unifies defenses; (2) Persuasion and other attacks exploit the lack of contextual understanding, which multi-modal feedback addresses; (3) Dynamic systems can adapt to novel attacks, unlike static rules. This approach is novel because it reframes safety as an intent-understanding problem, not just a content-filtering one. It has high impact because it addresses the root cause of jailbreaking (misaligned intent interpretation) and is scalable across languages and modalities. The work would include benchmarks against state-of-the-art attacks (e.g., GCG, PAIR) and defenses (e.g., SmoothLLM), demonstrating superior robustness."
