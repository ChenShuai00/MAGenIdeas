    "title": "Social Influence Dialogue Systems: A Scoping Survey of the Efforts Towards Influence Capabilities of Dialogue Systems",
    "abstract": "Dialogue systems capable of social in\ufb02uence such as persuasion, negotiation, and therapy, are essential for extending the use of technology to numerous realistic scenarios. However, existing research primarily focuses on either task-oriented or open-domain scenarios, a categorization that has been inadequate for capturing in\ufb02uence skills systematically. There exists no formal de\ufb01nition or category for dialogue systems with these skills and data-driven efforts in this direction are highly limited. In this work, we formally de\ufb01ne and introduce the category of social in\ufb02uence dialogue systems that in\ufb02uence users\u2019 cognitive and emotional responses, leading to changes in thoughts, opinions, and behaviors through natural conversations. We present a survey of various tasks, datasets, and methods, compiling the progress across seven diverse domains. We discuss the commonalities and differences between the examined systems, identify limitations, and recommend future directions. This study serves as a comprehensive reference for social in\ufb02uence dialogue systems to inspire more dedicated research and discussion in this emerging area."
