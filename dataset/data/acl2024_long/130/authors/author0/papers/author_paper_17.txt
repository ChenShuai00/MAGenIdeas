    "title": "Universal Dependencies for Punjabi",
    "abstract": "We introduce the first Universal Dependencies treebank for Punjabi (written in the Gurmukhi script) and discuss corpus design and linguistic phenomena encountered in annotation. The treebank covers a variety of genres and has been annotated for POS tags, dependency relations, and graph-based Enhanced Dependencies. We aim to expand the diversity of coverage of Indo-Aryan languages in UD."
