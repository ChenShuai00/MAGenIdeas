    "Title": "Cross-Lingual Metric Generalization: Evaluating MT Systems Across Diverse Language Pairs",
    "Idea": "This idea focuses on improving the generalization of machine translation metrics across diverse language pairs. Current metrics often perform well on high-resource language pairs (e.g., English-German) but struggle with low-resource or typologically distant pairs (e.g., English-Swahili). This research will investigate the factors that influence metric performance across languages and develop methods to enhance cross-lingual generalization. For example, the research could explore the use of multilingual embeddings, language-specific features, or transfer learning techniques to improve metric performance on low-resource languages. The proposed methods will be evaluated on a diverse set of language pairs, including both high-resource and low-resource languages, to ensure their robustness and applicability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Kitcher’s unified theory of science**, which emphasizes the importance of developing generalizable frameworks that can be applied across diverse contexts. The problem here is the limited generalization of current metrics across language pairs, which hinders their utility in multilingual MT evaluation. By proposing methods to enhance cross-lingual generalization, the research aims to address this limitation and provide a more inclusive approach to MT evaluation. The idea also draws on **Carnap’s inductive logic**, which focuses on identifying patterns and regularities across diverse datasets.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the increasing demand for multilingual MT systems, particularly for low-resource languages. Improving the generalization of metrics across language pairs can enable more accurate and equitable evaluation, supporting the development of MT systems for a wider range of languages. This research has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of MT evaluation, particularly in the context of global language diversity and inclusivity. Its focus on cross-lingual generalization and practical applicability makes it a strong candidate for recognition at top conferences."
