    "Title": "Error-Span-Based Evaluation: Leveraging Large Language Models for Fine-Grained MT Assessment",
    "Idea": "This paper proposes a new evaluation paradigm called **Error-Span-Based Evaluation (ESBE)**, which leverages large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to identify and categorize translation errors at a fine-grained level. ESBE uses LLMs to generate error spans and error types (e.g., semantic, syntactic) for each translation, providing a detailed and interpretable assessment of translation quality. The approach is validated on the ToShip23 dataset and compared against traditional metrics like BLEU and MQM. The paper also explores the potential of ESBE for low-resource languages and its ability to provide actionable feedback for MT system improvement.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (proposing a new hypothesis for fine-grained evaluation) and **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions** (shifting the paradigm from scalar metrics to error-span-based evaluation). The rationale is that current metrics provide only a single score, which lacks interpretability and actionable insights. ESBE addresses this by providing detailed error analysis, making it more useful for system development.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that fine-grained error analysis is critical for improving MT systems, but current metrics do not provide this level of detail. By leveraging LLMs, ESBE can provide a more informative and actionable evaluation, potentially leading to better system performance."
