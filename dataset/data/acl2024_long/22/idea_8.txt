    "Title": "Human-in-the-Loop MT Evaluation: Combining Automated Metrics with Crowdsourced Human Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hybrid evaluation framework that combines automated metrics with crowdsourced human feedback to provide more accurate and reliable MT evaluation. The framework will use active learning to identify ambiguous or challenging cases where automated metrics are likely to fail, and then solicit human feedback for these cases. The human feedback will be integrated into the evaluation process to improve the accuracy of the final scores. The framework will also include a mechanism for continuously updating the automated metrics based on the human feedback, ensuring that they remain aligned with human judgments over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (proposing a new hypothesis for combining automated and human evaluation) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (improving existing metrics by integrating human feedback). The hybrid approach addresses the limitations of both automated metrics and human evaluation, providing a more robust and scalable solution.",
    "Rationale": "Automated metrics are often criticized for their lack of alignment with human judgments, while human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming. By combining the strengths of both approaches, this idea has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and scalability of MT evaluation. This aligns with the growing interest in human-in-the-loop systems in NLP, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at conferences like ICLR or CVPR."
