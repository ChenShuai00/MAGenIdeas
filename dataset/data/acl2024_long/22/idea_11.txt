    "Title": "Domain-Specific Metric Thresholds: Tailoring MT Evaluation to Real-World Applications",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the development of domain-specific metric thresholds for machine translation evaluation. Current metrics often use generic thresholds that do not account for the unique characteristics of different domains (e.g., medical, legal, or technical translations). This research will investigate how metric performance varies across domains and establish domain-specific thresholds that better align with human judgments. For example, a medical translation might require higher precision in terminology, while a legal translation might prioritize consistency and adherence to formal language. The research will involve creating domain-specific evaluation datasets, analyzing the performance of existing metrics in these domains, and developing methods to adapt metric thresholds based on domain characteristics. The proposed thresholds will be validated through large-scale human evaluations, ensuring their practical utility in real-world applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which focuses on addressing practical problems in scientific research. The problem here is the mismatch between generic metric thresholds and the specific requirements of different domains. By tailoring thresholds to domain-specific needs, the research aims to improve the relevance and accuracy of MT evaluation. The idea also draws on **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**, which emphasizes identifying common patterns across multiple studies. In this case, the research synthesizes insights from domain-specific MT evaluations to develop a generalizable framework for threshold adaptation.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the increasing use of MT systems in specialized domains, where generic evaluation metrics may not adequately capture translation quality. Domain-specific thresholds can provide more accurate assessments, enabling better decision-making in research and deployment. This research has the potential to significantly impact industries that rely on high-quality translations, such as healthcare, legal services, and technical documentation. By addressing a critical gap in MT evaluation, the idea is well-positioned to make a substantial contribution to the field and attract attention at top conferences."
