    "Title": "Dynamic Range Adaptation: A New Approach to Metric Calibration for Machine Translation",
    "Idea": "This paper introduces a novel approach to metric calibration called **Dynamic Range Adaptation (DRA)**, which adjusts the scoring range of MT metrics based on the difficulty of the translation task and the quality of the reference translations. DRA uses a neural network to predict the optimal scoring range for a given test set, ensuring that metric deltas are meaningful and consistent across different datasets. The approach is validated on the ToShip23 dataset and compared against traditional calibration methods. The paper also explores the impact of DRA on system ranking and its ability to reduce the variability of metric scores across different domains and language pairs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (improving the accuracy and stability of existing metrics) and **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** (using neural networks to solve the calibration problem). The rationale is that current metrics often produce inconsistent scores across datasets, making it difficult to compare systems. DRA addresses this by dynamically adjusting the scoring range, leading to more reliable evaluations.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that metric calibration is a critical but understudied aspect of MT evaluation. By introducing DRA, this paper aims to improve the consistency and reliability of metric scores, making them more useful for research and deployment decisions."
