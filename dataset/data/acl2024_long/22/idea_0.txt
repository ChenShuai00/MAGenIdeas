    "Title": "Beyond BLEU: A Unified Framework for Human-Centric Machine Translation Evaluation",
    "Idea": "This paper proposes a unified framework for evaluating machine translation (MT) systems that integrates human-centric metrics, domain-specific thresholds, and learned metrics. The framework introduces a novel metric called **HUMAN-MT**, which combines human judgment annotations (e.g., MQM error spans) with learned metrics (e.g., COMET, BLEURT) to provide a more interpretable and reliable evaluation. The framework also includes a dynamic thresholding mechanism that adjusts evaluation criteria based on domain, language pair, and translation direction. The goal is to address the limitations of current metrics, such as BLEU, which fail to capture nuanced human judgments and domain-specific variations. The framework will be validated on the ToShip23 dataset and compared against existing metrics in terms of correlation with human judgments, stability across test set sizes, and adaptability to different domains.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (identifying anomalies in BLEU and other metrics) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (designing a new framework that integrates human-centric and learned metrics). The rationale is that current metrics are either too simplistic (e.g., BLEU) or too opaque (e.g., learned metrics), leading to a lack of trust and interpretability. By unifying human judgments and learned metrics, this framework aims to bridge the gap between automatic and human evaluation, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in MT evaluation.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea stems from the growing evidence that current MT metrics do not align well with human judgments, especially in domain-specific and low-resource settings. The proposed framework addresses this by incorporating human annotations and dynamic thresholds, making it more adaptable and reliable. This has the potential to significantly improve MT evaluation, leading to better system development and deployment decisions."
