    "Title": "Error-Driven MT Evaluation: Leveraging Fine-Grained Error Analysis for Robust Metric Design",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a new approach to MT evaluation that focuses on fine-grained error analysis to identify and penalize specific types of translation errors (e.g., semantic, syntactic, and morphological errors). The approach will use large-scale annotated datasets like DEMETR and MQM to train neural metrics that are sensitive to these errors. The metrics will be designed to provide detailed feedback on the types and severity of errors, enabling researchers and practitioners to better understand and improve MT systems. The approach will also include a challenge set for evaluating the robustness of metrics to different types of errors.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (explaining why current metrics fail to capture specific types of errors) and **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions** (shifting the paradigm from surface-level evaluation to error-driven evaluation). The focus on fine-grained error analysis addresses a critical gap in current MT evaluation practices.",
    "Rationale": "Current MT metrics often fail to capture specific types of errors, which can have serious consequences in real-world applications. By developing metrics that are sensitive to fine-grained errors, this idea has the potential to significantly improve the reliability and safety of MT systems. This aligns with the growing emphasis on robust and interpretable evaluation methods in NLP, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at conferences like ACL or NeurIPS."
