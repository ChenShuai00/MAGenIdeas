    "Title": "The Role of Domain-Specific Thresholds in MT Evaluation: A Large-Scale Empirical Study",
    "Idea": "This paper investigates the role of domain-specific thresholds in MT evaluation, focusing on how thresholds vary across different domains (e.g., news, medical, legal) and their impact on metric performance. The study uses the ToShip23 dataset to derive domain-specific thresholds for metrics like BLEU, COMET, and BLEURT and evaluates their effectiveness in improving correlation with human judgments. The paper also explores the feasibility of automatically predicting domain-specific thresholds using machine learning and proposes a new metric called **Domain-Adaptive MT Evaluation (DAME)**, which dynamically adjusts thresholds based on domain characteristics.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** (abstracting general laws from multiple studies) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (improving metric performance through domain-specific thresholds). The rationale is that current metrics use generic thresholds, which may not be appropriate for all domains. By introducing domain-specific thresholds, this study aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of MT evaluations.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that domain-specific variations are a major challenge in MT evaluation, but they are often ignored. By addressing this, the study can provide more accurate and domain-relevant evaluations, leading to better system development and deployment decisions."
