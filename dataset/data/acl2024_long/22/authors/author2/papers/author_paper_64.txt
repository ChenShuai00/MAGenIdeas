    "abstract": "Appropriate Named Entity handling is important for Statistical Machine Translation. In this work we address the challenging issues of generalization and sparsity of NEs in the context of SMT. Our approach uses the source NE Recognition (NER) system to generalize the training data by replacing the recognized Named Entities with place-holders, thus allowing a PhraseBased Statistical Machine Translation (PBMT) system to learn more general patterns. At translation time, the recognized Named Entities are handled through a specifically adapted translation model, which improves the quality of their translation. We add a post-processing step to a standard NER system in order to make it more suitable for integration with SMT and we also learn a prediction model for deciding between options for translating the Named Entities, based on their context and on their impact on the translation of the entire sentence. We show important improvements in terms of BLEU and TER scores already after integration of NER into SMT, but especially after applying the SMT-adapted post-processing step to the NER component."
