    "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been 001 through great revolutions in recent years. Ac-002 companied with improvements in translation 003 quality are works that attempted to understand 004 the working mechanism of various aspects of 005 the NMT framework. In our paper, we survey 006 those efforts on unveiling the black box of the 007 standard NMT framework. To begin with, we 008 brie\ufb02y introduce the three critical components 009 of the holistic NNT framework; nextly, we de-010 liver a clear component-centric categorization 011 and clean summary of these speci\ufb01c works 012 guided by frequently-asked questions (FAQs) 013 that aim at making up lack of understanding; 014 \ufb01nally, we discuss several limitations, future 015 directions and inspirations. We believe this pa-016 per could facilitate the community to weave 017 a holistic and clear picture of our current un-018 derstandings of the standard NMT framework 019 and shed light on its future improvements 020 and developments.
