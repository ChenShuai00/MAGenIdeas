    "abstract": "We present the results of the WMT 2024 shared task of the Open Language Data Initiative. Participants were invited to contribute to the FLO-RES+ and MT Seed multilingual datasets, two foundational open resources that facilitate the organic expansion of language technology\u2019s reach. We accepted ten submissions covering 16 languages, which extended the range of languages included in the datasets and improved the quality of existing data."
