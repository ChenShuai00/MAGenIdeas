    "title": "Using Domain-specific and Collaborative Resources for Term Translation",
    "abstract": "In this article we investigate the translation of terms from English into German and vice versa in the isolation of an ontology vocabulary. For this study we built new domain-specific resources from the translation search engine Linguee and from the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. We learned that a domain-specific resource produces better results than a bigger, but more general one. The first finding of our research is that the vocabulary and the structure of the parallel corpus are important. By integrating the multilingual knowledge base Wikipedia, we further improved the translation wrt. the domain-specific resources, whereby some translation evaluation metrics outperformed the results of Google Translate. This finding leads us to the conclusion that a hybrid translation system, a combination of bilingual terminological resources and statistical machine translation can help to improve translation of domain-specific terms."
