    "title": "CUNI Submission for the Inuktitut Language in WMT News 2020",
    "abstract": "This paper describes CUNI submission to the WMT 2020 News Translation Shared Task for the low-resource scenario Inuktitut\u2013English in both translation directions. Our system combines transfer learning from a Czech\u2013English high-resource language pair and backtranslation. We notice surprising behaviour when using synthetic data, which can be possibly attributed to a narrow domain of training and test data. We are using the Transformer model in a constrained submission."
