    "title": "Trivial Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation",
    "abstract": "Transfer learning has been proven as an effective technique for neural machine translation under low-resource conditions. Existing methods require a common target language, language relatedness, or specific training tricks and regimes. We present a simple transfer learning method, where we first train a \u201cparent\u201d model for a high-resource language pair and then continue the training on a low-resource pair only by replacing the training corpus. This \u201cchild\u201d model performs significantly better than the baseline trained for low-resource pair only. We are the first to show this for targeting different languages, and we observe the improvements even for unrelated languages with different alphabets."
