    "title": "Cometoid: Distilling Strong Reference-based Machine Translation Metrics into Even Stronger Quality Estimation Metrics",
    "abstract": "This paper describes our submissions to the 2023 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT-23) Metrics shared task. Knowledge distillation is commonly used to create smaller student models that mimic larger teacher model while reducing the model size and hence inference cost in production. In this work, we apply knowledge distillation to machine translation evaluation metrics and distill existing reference-based teacher metrics into reference-free (quality estimation; QE) student metrics. We mainly focus on students of Unbabel\u2019s COMET22 reference-based metric. When evaluating on the official WMT-22 Metrics evaluation task, our distilled Cometoid QE metrics outperform all other QE metrics on that set while matching or out-performing the reference-based teacher metric. Our metrics never see the human ground-truth scores directly \u2013 only the teacher metric was trained on human scores by its original creators. We also distill ChrF sentence-level scores into a neural QE metric and find that our reference-free (and fully human-score-free) student metric ChrFoid outperforms its teacher metric by over 7% pairwise accuracy on the same WMT-22 task, rivaling other existing QE metrics."
