    "Title": "Dynamic Metric Adaptation: Tailoring MT Evaluation Metrics to Domain and Language-Specific Contexts",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic adaptation mechanism for MT evaluation metrics that automatically adjusts their scoring criteria based on the domain and language pair being evaluated. The mechanism will use domain-specific datasets and language-specific linguistic features to fine-tune the weights of different evaluation dimensions (e.g., fluency, adequacy, and cultural appropriateness). The approach will leverage transfer learning and multilingual language models to ensure scalability across diverse domains and languages. The resulting metrics will be validated through large-scale human evaluations and compared against existing metrics to demonstrate their superiority in domain-specific and low-resource settings.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (explaining why current metrics fail in domain-specific and low-resource contexts) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (designing a method that adapts to specific contexts). The dynamic adaptation mechanism addresses the limitations of one-size-fits-all metrics, which often perform poorly in specialized domains or for low-resource languages.",
    "Rationale": "MT systems are increasingly being deployed in specialized domains (e.g., legal, medical) and for low-resource languages, where traditional metrics like BLEU are inadequate. By developing metrics that dynamically adapt to these contexts, this idea has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of MT evaluation. This aligns with the growing emphasis on domain-specific and low-resource NLP research, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at conferences like ICLR or CVPR."
