    "Title": "Human-in-the-Loop Metric Calibration: Aligning Automated Evaluation with Human Preferences",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a human-in-the-loop approach to calibrating machine translation metrics, ensuring that automated evaluations align more closely with human preferences. Current metrics often rely on static training data and may not fully capture the nuances of human judgment. This research will develop a framework that incorporates continuous human feedback to refine and calibrate metric parameters. For example, the framework could use active learning techniques to identify ambiguous or challenging cases for human annotation, which are then used to update the metric. The research will also explore the use of preference learning to model human judgments more accurately, enabling the metric to better reflect human preferences in its evaluations. The framework will be validated through large-scale human studies, comparing its performance to existing metrics.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Mayo’s experimental reasoning theory**, which emphasizes the importance of iterative experimentation and feedback in scientific research. The problem here is the misalignment between automated metrics and human judgments, which limits the utility of metrics in real-world applications. By proposing a human-in-the-loop approach, the research aims to address this misalignment and provide a more human-centric approach to MT evaluation. The idea also draws on **Sutton’s model of scientific serendipity**, which highlights the role of unexpected insights and feedback in driving scientific discovery.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the critical role of human judgment in MT evaluation, particularly in high-stakes applications. By incorporating human feedback into the calibration process, the research aims to create metrics that better reflect human preferences and provide more accurate evaluations. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the reliability and utility of automated metrics, making it highly relevant for both academic and industrial applications. Its focus on human-centric evaluation and iterative improvement makes it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences."
