    "Title": "Dynamic Metric Adaptation: Real-Time Evaluation for Evolving MT Systems",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework for dynamic metric adaptation, enabling real-time evaluation of machine translation systems as they evolve. Current evaluation practices often rely on static metrics and datasets, which may not reflect the latest improvements or regressions in MT systems. This research will develop a dynamic evaluation framework that continuously updates metric parameters based on new data and system outputs. For example, the framework could incorporate feedback from post-editors or end-users to refine metric weights and thresholds. The research will also explore the use of online learning techniques to adapt metrics in real-time, ensuring that evaluations remain accurate and relevant. The framework will be tested in a live deployment scenario, where it will be used to monitor and evaluate the performance of an MT system over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem solving**, which emphasizes iterative improvement and adaptation. The problem here is the static nature of current evaluation practices, which fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving MT systems. By proposing a dynamic evaluation framework, the research aims to address this limitation and provide a more responsive approach to MT evaluation. The idea also draws on **Hacking’s experimental system theory**, which highlights the importance of continuous experimentation and refinement in scientific research.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the fast-paced nature of MT research and development, where systems are constantly updated and improved. Static evaluation metrics may not capture these changes, leading to outdated or misleading assessments. A dynamic evaluation framework can provide more accurate and timely feedback, enabling researchers and developers to make informed decisions. This research has the potential to significantly improve the agility and effectiveness of MT evaluation, making it highly relevant for both academic and industrial applications. Its innovative approach and practical impact make it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences."
