    "Title": "Meta-Evaluation of MT Metrics: A Large-Scale Study of Metric Robustness and Generalizability",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a large-scale meta-evaluation study to systematically assess the robustness and generalizability of existing MT metrics. The study will evaluate metrics on a diverse set of language pairs, domains, and error types, using both human judgments and challenge sets. The study will also investigate the impact of different evaluation protocols (e.g., statistical significance testing, reference quality) on metric performance. The results of the study will be used to develop guidelines for selecting and using MT metrics in different contexts, as well as to identify areas for future metric development.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions** (identifying accumulated anomalies in current metric evaluation practices) and **Laudan’s problem-solving progress assessment** (evaluating the progress of metric development). The meta-evaluation study addresses the lack of systematic assessment of metric robustness and generalizability, which is critical for advancing MT research.",
    "Rationale": "The proliferation of MT metrics has made it difficult for researchers and practitioners to select the most appropriate metric for their needs. By conducting a large-scale meta-evaluation study, this idea has the potential to provide much-needed clarity and guidance on metric selection and use. This aligns with the growing emphasis on reproducibility and transparency in NLP research, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at conferences like ACL or NeurIPS."
