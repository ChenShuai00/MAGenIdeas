    "Title": "Interpretable Neural Metrics: Bridging the Gap Between Human Judgments and Automated Evaluation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes the development of interpretable neural metrics for machine translation evaluation. While neural-based metrics like COMET and BLEURT have shown high correlation with human judgments, their 'black-box' nature limits their utility in understanding why a translation is deemed high or low quality. This research will focus on designing neural metrics that not only predict translation quality but also provide interpretable explanations for their predictions. For example, the metric could highlight specific errors (e.g., mistranslations, omissions, or grammatical errors) and explain how these errors contribute to the overall score. The metric will be trained using a combination of human-annotated error spans (e.g., MQM annotations) and synthetic data generated through controlled perturbations. The interpretability of the metric will be evaluated through user studies with professional translators and MT researchers, assessing whether the explanations align with human intuition and improve trust in automated evaluation.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes identifying anomalies in existing theories. The anomaly here is the lack of interpretability in state-of-the-art neural metrics, despite their high correlation with human judgments. By addressing this gap, the research aims to shift the paradigm of MT evaluation towards more transparent and trustworthy metrics. Additionally, **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is used to propose a novel hypothesis: that interpretable neural metrics can bridge the gap between human judgments and automated evaluation. The hypothesis is tested through the development of a new metric and its evaluation in real-world scenarios.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the growing reliance on neural metrics for MT evaluation, coupled with the need for transparency and trust in automated systems. Interpretable metrics can provide actionable feedback to MT developers, enabling them to improve system performance more effectively. Furthermore, interpretability is crucial for deploying MT systems in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal translation, where understanding the rationale behind a metric's score is as important as the score itself. By combining interpretability with high accuracy, this research has the potential to revolutionize MT evaluation and set a new standard for automated metrics."
