    "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a central task 001 in many applications, e.g., machine transla-002 tion, question answering, summarization, and 003 more recently, complex tasks such as stance 004 detection. However, cross-lingual projection of 005 SRL labels has remained a thorny problem in 006 NLP. The scarcity of semantically annotated 007 corpora makes it difficult to build semantic 008 role labelers, particularly for languages where 009 hand-annotated labels are not readily available. 010 We leverage semantic isomorphism at the level 011 of predicate-argument structure to induce SRL 012 systems from unlabeled bilingual corpora. We 013 demonstrate that this approach yields explain-014 able representations that readily project to new 015 languages. Our novel contribution is the use of 016 a simple word-to-word alignment followed by a 017 First Come First Assign (FCFA) algorithm and 018 a handful of linguistically-informed constraints 019 specified at the predicate-argument level. These 020 constraints provide a systematic mapping to 021 semantic-role divergence categories that serve 022 as the basis for analysis of our FCFA approach. 023 A two-step process rapidly produces explain-024 able SRL output: simple alignment followed by 025 application of FCFA. This approach yields SRL 026 projection results that are comparable to state 027 of the art performance (XSRL), but without 028 relying on complex transformer-based scoring 029 schemes for multi-word alignments. 030"
