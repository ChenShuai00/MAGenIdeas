    "title": "REALM: Robust Entropy Adaptive Loss Minimization for Improved Single-Sample Test-Time Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Fully-test-time adaptation (F-TTA) can mitigate performance loss due to distribution shifts between train and test data (1) without access to the training data, and (2) without knowledge of the model training procedure. In online F-TTA, a pre-trained model is adapted using a stream of test samples by minimizing a self-supervised objective, such as entropy minimization. However, models adapted with online using entropy minimization, are unstable especially in single sample settings, leading to degenerate solutions, and limiting the adoption of TTA inference strategies. Prior works identify noisy, or unreliable, samples as a cause of failure in online F-TTA. One solution is to ignore these samples, which can lead to bias in the update procedure, slow adaptation, and poor generalization. In this work, we present a general framework for improving robustness of F-TTA to these noisy samples, inspired by self-paced learning and robust loss functions. Our proposed approach, Robust Entropy Adaptive Loss Minimization (REALM), achieves better adaptation accuracy than previous approaches throughout the adaptation process on corruptions of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, demonstrating its effectiveness."
