    "title": "Proteomic profiling of intact proteins using WAX-RPLC 2-D separations and FTICR mass spectrometry.",
    "abstract": "We investigated the combination of weak anion exchange (WAX) fractionation and on-line reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) separation using a 12 T FTICR mass spectrometer for the detection of intact proteins from a Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cell lysate. This work aimed at optimizing intact protein detection for profiling proteins at a level that incorporates their modification state. A total of 715 intact proteins were detected, and the combined results from the WAX fractions and the unfractionated cell lysate were aligned using LC-MS features to facilitate protein abundance measurements. Protein identifications and post-translational modifications were assigned for approximately 10% of the detected proteins by comparing intact protein mass measurements to proteins identified in peptide MS/MS analysis of an aliquot of the same fraction. Intact proteins were also detected for S. oneidensis lysates obtained from cells grown on 13C-, 15N-depleted media under aerobic and sub-oxic conditions. The strategy can be readily applied for measuring differential protein abundances and provides a platform for high-throughput selection of biologically relevant targets for further characterization."
