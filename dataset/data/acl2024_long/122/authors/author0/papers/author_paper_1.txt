    "title": "Scaling Laws for Data Filtering\u2014Data Curation Cannot be Compute Agnostic",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are trained for thousands of GPU hours on carefully selected subsets of massive web scrapes. For instance, the LAION public dataset retained only about 10% of the total crawled data. In recent times, data curation has gained prominence with several works developing strategies to retain \u2018high-quality\u2019 subsets of \u2018raw\u2019 scraped data. However, these strategies are typically developed agnostic to the available compute for training. In this paper, we demonstrate that making filtering decisions independent of training compute is often suboptimal\u2014well-curated data rapidly loses its utility when repeated, eventually decreasing below the utility of \u2018unseen\u2019 but \u2018lower-quality\u2019 data. While past research in neural scaling laws has considered web data to be homogenous, real data is not. Our work bridges this important gap in the literature by developing scaling laws that characterize the differing \u2018utility\u2019 of various data subsets, and accounting for how this diminishes for a data point at its \u2018nth\u2019 repetition. Our key message is that data curation can not be agnostic of the total compute a model will be trained for. Even without ever jointly training on multiple data buckets, our scaling laws enable us to estimate model performance under this dynamic trade-off between quality and repetition. This allows us to curate the best possible pool for achieving top performance on Datacomp at various compute budgets, carving out a pareto-frontier for data curation."
