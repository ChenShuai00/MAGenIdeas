    "title": "Drawing Multiple Augmentation Samples Per Image During Training Efficiently Decreases Test Error",
    "abstract": "In computer vision, it is standard practice to draw a single sample from the data augmentation procedure for each unique image in the mini-batch. However recent work has suggested drawing multiple samples can achieve higher test accuracies. In this work, we provide a detailed empirical evaluation of how the number of augmentation samples per unique image influences model performance on held out data when training deep ResNets. We demonstrate drawing multiple samples per image consistently enhances the test accuracy achieved for both small and large batch training. Crucially, this benefit arises even if different numbers of augmentations per image perform the same number of parameter updates and gradient evaluations (requiring the same total compute). Although prior work has found variance in the gradient estimate arising from subsampling the dataset has an implicit regularization benefit, our experiments suggest variance which arises from the data augmentation process harms generalization. We apply these insights to the highly performant NFNet-F5, achieving 86.8$\\%$ top-1 w/o extra data on ImageNet."
