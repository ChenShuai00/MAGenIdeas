    "title": "Dynamics of Brain Lateralization during Chinese Natural Speech Processing under the Influence of Sex Hormones: a 7T fMRI study",
    "abstract": "Though language is considered unique to humans with left dominant lateralization in the brain, the dynamic nature of the interplay between hemispheres during language processing remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whole-brain functional dynamic lateralization patterns during Chinese language processing and potential sex disparities using functional MRI data of 20 subjects listening to narrative stories in a 7T MRI scanner. Our findings revealed two distinct dynamic lateralization states, with regions of the language system consistently showing the left lateralization but reversed lateralization for other regions. These two states, characterized by higher-level functioning regions exhibiting left- or right-lateralization, corresponded to the processing of rational and emotional contents, respectively. We observed pronounced inclinations towards the former state in males and the latter state in females, especially during the processing of rational contents. Finally, genetic analyses revealed that the sex differences in lateralization states were potentially influenced by sex hormones."
