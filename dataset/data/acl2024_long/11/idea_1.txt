    "Title": "Cross-Domain Self-Distillation for Enhanced Generalization",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of cross-domain self-distillation, where the model generates distilled datasets from multiple domains during fine-tuning. By incorporating knowledge from diverse domains, the model can achieve better generalization across different tasks and datasets, reducing the distribution gap and enhancing its ability to follow general instructions.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory and Carnap’s inductive logic. By integrating knowledge from multiple domains, we can abstract and summarize general laws that improve the model's performance across various tasks. This approach also leverages the concept of interdisciplinary knowledge integration, as suggested by Kuhn’s paradigm theory.",
    "Rationale": "Cross-domain self-distillation can help the model learn more robust and generalizable features, which are essential for maintaining performance across diverse tasks. This method can also mitigate the risk of overfitting to specific task datasets, leading to better overall performance and adaptability.",
