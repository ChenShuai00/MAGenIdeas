    "title": "O(N2) Universal Antisymmetry in Fermionic Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Fermionic neural network (FermiNet) is a re-cently proposed wavefunction Ansatz, which is used in variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods to solve the many-electron Schr\u00a8odinger equation. FermiNet proposes permutation-equivariant architectures, on which a Slater determinant is applied to induce antisymmetry. FermiNet is proved to have universal approximation capabil-ity with a single determinant, namely, it suf\ufb01ces to represent any antisymmetric function given suf\ufb01cient parameters. However, the asymptotic computational bottleneck comes from the Slater determinant, which scales with O ( N 3 ) for N electrons. In this paper, we substitute the Slater determinant with a pairwise antisymmetry construction, which is easy to implement and can re-duce the computational cost to O ( N 2 ) . We formally prove that the pairwise construction built upon permutation-equivariant architectures can universally represent any antisymmetric function. Besides, this can be achieved via continuous approximators when we aim to represent ground-state wavefunctions."
