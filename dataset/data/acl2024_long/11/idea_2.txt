    "Title": "Self-Distillation with Safety Alignment Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a safety alignment feedback loop within the self-distillation process. The model would generate distilled datasets and simultaneously evaluate their safety alignment. Based on this feedback, the model would adjust its distillation process to ensure that the fine-tuned model maintains high safety standards while improving task performance.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings and Sutton’s model of scientific serendipity. By integrating safety alignment feedback, we can address the challenge of maintaining safety in fine-tuned models, which is crucial for real-world applications. This approach also aligns with the need to explain and integrate anomalous findings, as highlighted by Kuhn’s theory of crises and revolutions.",
    "Rationale": "Safety alignment is a critical aspect of LLM deployment, and integrating it into the self-distillation process can ensure that the model remains safe and aligned with human values. This method can also help in identifying and mitigating potential safety risks early in the fine-tuning process, leading to more reliable and trustworthy models.",
