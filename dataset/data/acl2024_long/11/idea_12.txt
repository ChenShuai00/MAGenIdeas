    "Title": "Cross-Domain Self-Distillation for Generalizable LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea extends Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT) to cross-domain scenarios, where the model is fine-tuned on data from multiple domains (e.g., text, code, and math) using a unified distillation framework. The approach involves generating distilled datasets for each domain and using a shared distillation mechanism to ensure the model retains generalizable knowledge across domains. The key innovation is the introduction of a domain-agnostic distillation loss that encourages the model to learn domain-invariant features. This method aims to produce LLMs that can generalize across diverse domains without sacrificing domain-specific performance. The approach will be evaluated on cross-domain benchmarks, including text-to-code and text-to-math tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the need for new paradigms to address cross-domain challenges. **Laudan’s problem-solving model** is used to identify the problem of domain-specific fine-tuning leading to poor generalization. **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is applied to propose the hypothesis that cross-domain self-distillation can improve generalization. The domain-agnostic distillation loss is a creative leap inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**. Finally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** guides the design of the unified distillation framework, ensuring it is both innovative and feasible.",
    "Rationale": "Generalization across domains is a critical challenge in LLM research, as models often struggle to transfer knowledge from one domain to another. Current methods, including SDFT, focus on single-domain fine-tuning and do not address cross-domain generalization. This idea fills this gap by introducing a cross-domain distillation framework that encourages the model to learn domain-invariant features. The potential impact is significant, as it enables LLMs to perform well across diverse domains, making them more versatile and applicable to real-world tasks.",
