    "Title": "Hierarchical Self-Distillation for Multi-Level Task Adaptation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hierarchical self-distillation approach where the model performs distillation at multiple levels of task complexity. The model would first distill high-level task knowledge and then progressively refine it with more detailed task-specific information. This hierarchical approach can help in better adapting the model to complex tasks while preserving its general instruction-following abilities.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Kitcher’s unified theory of science and Lakoff’s conceptual metaphor theory. By structuring the distillation process hierarchically, we can construct and modify theoretical models that better capture the complexity of real-world tasks. This approach also aligns with the need for a balance between reductionism and emergence, as suggested by Quine’s holism.",
    "Rationale": "Hierarchical self-distillation can address the challenge of adapting LLMs to tasks with varying levels of complexity. By breaking down the distillation process into multiple levels, the model can better capture the nuances of complex tasks while maintaining its general capabilities, leading to improved performance and adaptability.",
