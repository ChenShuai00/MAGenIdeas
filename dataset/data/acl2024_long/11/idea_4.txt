    "Title": "Self-Distillation with Continual Learning Mechanisms",
    "Idea": "This idea integrates continual learning mechanisms into the self-distillation process to enable the model to learn new tasks sequentially without forgetting previously learned knowledge. The model would use self-distillation to generate distilled datasets for new tasks while incorporating techniques from continual learning to preserve its existing knowledge.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Lakatos’s research program methodology and Feyerabend’s methodological anarchism. By combining self-distillation with continual learning, we can explore the limitations and shortcomings of current methods and develop a more robust approach to fine-tuning LLMs. This approach also leverages the concept of methodological improvement, as suggested by Laudan’s model.",
    "Rationale": "Continual learning is essential for LLMs to adapt to new tasks over time without forgetting previously learned knowledge. By integrating continual learning mechanisms into self-distillation, the model can achieve better long-term performance and adaptability, making it more suitable for real-world applications where tasks evolve over time.",
