    "Title": "Self-Distillation for Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT) to enhance few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities in LLMs. The approach involves generating distilled datasets that capture the model's original distribution and using these datasets to fine-tune the model for few-shot and zero-shot tasks. The key innovation is the introduction of a meta-distillation mechanism that adapts the distillation process based on the task's few-shot or zero-shot nature. This method aims to produce LLMs that can perform well on new tasks with minimal or no task-specific training data. The approach will be evaluated on few-shot and zero-shot benchmarks, including NLP and code generation tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which highlights the need for new paradigms to address few-shot and zero-shot learning challenges. **Laudan’s problem-solving model** is used to identify the problem of poor performance in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is applied to propose the hypothesis that self-distillation can improve few-shot and zero-shot learning. The meta-distillation mechanism is a creative leap inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**. Finally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** guides the design of the meta-distillation process, ensuring it is both innovative and practical.",
    "Rationale": "Few-shot and zero-shot learning are critical capabilities for LLMs, as they enable models to perform well on new tasks with minimal training data. Current methods, including SDFT, do not explicitly address few-shot and zero-shot learning. This idea fills this gap by introducing a meta-distillation mechanism that adapts the distillation process to these scenarios. The potential impact is significant, as it enables LLMs to be more flexible and adaptable, making them more useful in real-world applications where task-specific data is scarce.",
