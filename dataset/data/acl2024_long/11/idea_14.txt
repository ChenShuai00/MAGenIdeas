    "Title": "Self-Distillation with Explainability for Transparent LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea integrates explainability techniques with Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT) to produce transparent and interpretable LLMs. The approach involves generating distilled datasets that not only match the model's original distribution but also include explanations for the model's predictions. The key innovation is the introduction of an explainability-aware distillation loss that encourages the model to generate interpretable outputs. This method aims to produce LLMs that are not only highly performant but also transparent, enabling users to understand and trust the model's decisions. The approach will be evaluated on explainability benchmarks and real-world tasks, such as medical diagnosis and legal reasoning, to demonstrate its effectiveness.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the need for new paradigms to address the lack of transparency in LLMs. **Laudan’s problem-solving model** is used to identify the problem of opaque decision-making in LLMs. **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is applied to propose the hypothesis that integrating explainability with self-distillation can improve transparency. The explainability-aware distillation loss is a creative leap inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**. Finally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** guides the integration of explainability techniques with SDFT, ensuring the approach is both innovative and practical.",
    "Rationale": "Transparency and interpretability are critical concerns in LLM deployment, as users need to understand and trust the model's decisions. Current methods, including SDFT, do not explicitly address explainability. This idea fills this gap by integrating explainability techniques with SDFT, ensuring that models are not only performant but also transparent. The potential impact is significant, as it enables the deployment of LLMs in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare and law, where transparency is essential.",
