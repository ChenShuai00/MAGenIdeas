    "Title": "Self-Distillation with Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Adaptation in Large Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea combines Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT) with meta-learning to enable few-shot adaptation in LLMs. The approach uses self-distillation to generate a distilled dataset that matches the model’s original distribution, while meta-learning is employed to fine-tune the model on new tasks with limited data. The method introduces a meta-distillation mechanism that prioritizes knowledge transfer between related tasks, ensuring that the model can adapt effectively to new tasks with minimal data. Additionally, the approach incorporates a safety alignment module to prevent the generation of harmful content during few-shot adaptation.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the importance of exploring theoretical boundaries (e.g., few-shot adaptation). **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is used to propose the meta-distillation mechanism as a creative solution to the problem of few-shot adaptation. **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** guides the design of the safety alignment module to enhance the robustness of the method.",
    "Rationale": "Few-shot adaptation is a critical challenge for LLMs, as they often struggle to perform well on new tasks with limited data. This idea addresses this challenge by leveraging self-distillation in a meta-learning framework, ensuring that the model can adapt effectively to new tasks with minimal data. The inclusion of a safety alignment module ensures that the model remains aligned with ethical guidelines during few-shot adaptation. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the versatility and reliability of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
