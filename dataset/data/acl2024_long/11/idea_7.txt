    "Title": "Cross-Domain Self-Distillation for Generalization in Large Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a cross-domain self-distillation framework to improve the generalization capabilities of LLMs. The approach involves fine-tuning the model on a diverse set of tasks and domains, using self-distillation to generate a distilled dataset that captures the common patterns across domains. The method introduces a domain-aware distillation mechanism that prioritizes knowledge transfer between related domains, ensuring that the model can generalize effectively to unseen tasks and domains. Additionally, the approach incorporates a domain-specific safety alignment module to prevent the generation of harmful content in different domains.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the importance of exploring theoretical boundaries (e.g., generalization across domains). **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is used to propose the domain-aware distillation mechanism as a creative solution to the problem of domain generalization. **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** guides the design of the domain-specific safety alignment module to enhance the robustness of the method.",
    "Rationale": "Generalization across domains is a critical challenge for LLMs, as they often struggle to perform well on tasks outside their training distribution. This idea addresses this challenge by leveraging self-distillation in a domain-aware manner, ensuring that the model can generalize effectively to unseen tasks and domains. The inclusion of a domain-specific safety alignment module ensures that the model remains aligned with ethical guidelines across different domains. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the versatility and reliability of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
