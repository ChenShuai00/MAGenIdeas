    "title": "MoDS: Model-oriented Data Selection for Instruction Tuning",
    "abstract": "Instruction tuning has become the de facto method to equip large language models (LLMs) with the ability of following user instructions. Usually, hundreds of thousands or millions of instruction-following pairs are employed to fine-tune the foundation LLMs. Recently, some studies show that a small number of high-quality instruction data is enough. However, how to select appropriate instruction data for a given LLM is still an open problem. To address this problem, in this paper we present a model-oriented data selection (MoDS) approach, which selects instruction data based on a new criteria considering three aspects: quality, coverage and necessity. First, our approach utilizes a quality evaluation model to filter out the high-quality subset from the original instruction dataset, and then designs an algorithm to further select from the high-quality subset a seed instruction dataset with good coverage. The seed dataset is applied to fine-tune the foundation LLM to obtain an initial instruction-following LLM. Finally, we develop a necessity evaluation model to find out the instruction data which are performed badly in the initial instruction-following LLM and consider them necessary instructions to further improve the LLMs. In this way, we can get a small high-quality, broad-coverage and high-necessity subset from the original instruction datasets. Experimental results show that, the model fine-tuned with 4,000 instruction pairs selected by our approach could perform better than the model fine-tuned with the full original dataset which includes 214k instruction data."
