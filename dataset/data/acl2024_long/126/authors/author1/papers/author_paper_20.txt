    "title": "CP-EB: Talking Face Generation with Controllable Pose and Eye Blinking Embedding",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a talking face generation method named \u201cCP-EB\u201d that takes an audio signal as input and a person image as reference, to synthesize a photo-realistic people talking video with head poses controlled by a short video clip and proper eye blinking embedding. It\u2019s noted that not only the head pose but also eye blinking are both important aspects for deep fake detection. The implicit control of poses by video has already achieved by the state-of-art work. According to recent research, eye blinking has weak correlation with input audio which means eye blinks extraction from audio and generation are possible. Hence, we propose a GAN-based architecture to extract eye blink feature from input audio and reference video respectively and employ contrastive training between them, then embed it into the concatenated features of identity and poses to generate talking face images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate photo-realistic talking face with synchronous lips motions, natural head poses and blinking eyes."
