    "title": "ED-TTS: Multi-Scale Emotion Modeling Using Cross-Domain Emotion Diarization for Emotional Speech Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Existing emotional speech synthesis methods often utilize an utterance-level style embedding extracted from reference audio, neglecting the inherent multi-scale property of speech prosody. We introduce ED-TTS, a multi-scale emotional speech synthesis model that leverages Speech Emotion Diarization (SED) and Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) to model emotions at different levels. Specifically, our proposed approach integrates the utterance-level emotion embedding extracted by SER with fine-grained frame-level emotion embedding obtained from SED. These embeddings are used to condition the reverse process of the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Additionally, we employ cross-domain SED to accurately predict soft labels, addressing the challenge of a scarcity of fine-grained emotion-annotated datasets for supervising emotional TTS training."
