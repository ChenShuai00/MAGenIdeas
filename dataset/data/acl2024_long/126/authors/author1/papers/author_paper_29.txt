    "title": "Contrastive Latent Space Reconstruction Learning for Audio-Text Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) has been extensively applied in various domains, such as multimedia search engines and recommendation systems. Most existing CMR methods focus on image-to-text retrieval, whereas audio-to-text retrieval, a less explored domain, has posed a great challenge due to the difficulty to uncover discriminative features from audio clips and texts. Existing studies are restricted in the following two ways: 1) Most researchers utilize contrastive learning to construct a common subspace where similarities among data can be measured. However, they considers only cross-modal transformation, neglecting the intra-modal separability. Besides, the temperature parameter is not adaptively adjusted along with semantic guidance, which degrades the performance. 2) These methods do not take latent representation reconstruction into account, which is essential for semantic alignment. This paper introduces a novel audio-text oriented CMR approach, termed Contrastive Latent Space Reconstruction Learning (CLSR). CLSR improves contrastive representation learning by taking intra-modal separability into account and adopting an adaptive temperature control strategy. Moreover, the latent representation reconstruction modules are embedded into the CMR framework, which improves modal interaction. Experiments in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods on two audio-text datasets have validated the superiority of CLSR."
