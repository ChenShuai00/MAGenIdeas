    "title": "Learning Disentangled Speech Representations with Contrastive Learning and Time-Invariant Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Voice conversion refers to transferring speaker identity with well-preserved content. Better disentanglement of speech representations leads to better voice conversion. Recent studies have found that phonetic information from input audio has the potential ability to well represent content. Besides, the speaker-style modeling with pre-trained models making the process more complex. To tackle these issues, we introduce an new method named \"CTVC\" which utilizes disen-tangled speech representations with contrastive learning and time-invariant retrieval.Specifically, a similarity-based compression module is used to facilitate a more intimate connection between the frame-level hidden features and linguistic information at phoneme-level. Additionally, a time-invariant retrieval is proposed for timbre extraction based on multiple segmentation and mutual information. Experimental results demonstrate that \"CTVC\" outperforms previous studies and improves the sound quality and similarity of converted results."
