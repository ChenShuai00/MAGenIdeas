    "title": "Learning Motion Dynamics to Catch a Flying Object",
    "abstract": "In this abstract, we consider a novel approach to control the timing of motions when these are encoded with autonomous dynamical systems. Accurate motion timing is highly important if a robot has to synchronize its movements with the dynamics of a moving object. In previous work of ours [1], we developed an approach to learning motion dynamics from demonstrations performed by a human user. Encoding motions as autonomous dynamical systems(DS) provides an efficient way to generate and adapt motions to external perturbations, while ensuring high accuracy at the target. Catching an object on the fly requires very accurate estimate of the dynamics of motion of the object. This depends on accurate sensing which cannot always be ensured in robotics. One thus needs to quickly-adapt the planned trajectory so as to catch the object on time when receiving a novel (more accurate) estimate of the object\u2019s motion. DS encoding offers a very powerful way to recompute on-the-fly trajectories, while ensuring that both the dynamics is correctly regenerated. Here, you investigate the ours of DS to encode control of the motion\u2019s duration so as to speed up or slow down a motion during reproduction and therefore to adhere to temporal constraints. We validate the proposed method in an experiment where the i-Cub robot learns to catch a ball on the fly."
