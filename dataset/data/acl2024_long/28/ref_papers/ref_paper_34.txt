    "title": "Using Knowledge of Children\u2019s Mathematics Thinking in Classroom Teaching: An Experimental Study",
    "abstract": "This study investigated teachers\u2019 use of knowledge from research on children\u2019s mathematical thinking and how their students\u2019 achievement is influenced as a result. Twenty first grade teachers, assigned randomly to an experimental treatment, participated in a month-long workshop in which they studied a research-based analysis of children\u2019s development of problem-solving skills in addition and subtraction. Other first grade teachers (n = 20) were assigned randomly to a control group. Although instructional practices were not prescribed, experimental teachers taught problem solving significantly more and number facts significantly less than did control teachers. Experimental teachers encouraged students to use a variety of problem-solving strategies, and they listened to processes their students used significantly more than did control teachers. Experimental teachers knew more about individual students\u2019 problem-solving processes, and they believed that instruction should build on students\u2019 existing knowledge more than did control teachers. Students in experimental classes exceeded students in control classes in number fact knowledge, problem solving, reported understanding, and reported confidence in their problem-solving abilities."
