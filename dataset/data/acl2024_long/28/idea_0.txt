    "Title": "RobustMath: A Framework for Enhancing LLM Robustness in Mathematical Reasoning through Adversarial Training and Self-Verification",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a new framework, RobustMath, that combines adversarial training with self-verification mechanisms to enhance the robustness of LLMs in mathematical reasoning. The framework introduces a novel adversarial training dataset, RobustMath-Adv, which includes a wide range of perturbed mathematical problems designed to expose and mitigate the weaknesses of LLMs. Additionally, RobustMath integrates a self-verification module that allows LLMs to iteratively verify and correct their reasoning steps, inspired by the success of self-consistency and iterative refinement techniques. The framework also includes a new evaluation metric, Robustness Score, which measures the consistency of LLM performance across different problem variations. By addressing the fragility of LLMs in mathematical reasoning, RobustMath aims to set a new standard for evaluating and improving LLM robustness in mathematical tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (Law 1), which emphasizes identifying anomalies in existing paradigms. The observed fragility of LLMs in mathematical reasoning represents such an anomaly, and RobustMath seeks to address it by introducing a new framework for adversarial training and self-verification. The self-verification module is inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** (Law 2), which suggests that iterative problem-solving can lead to scientific discovery. The adversarial training dataset, RobustMath-Adv, is designed using **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (Law 4), which focuses on improving existing methods by integrating new technologies and tools. Finally, the Robustness Score is developed using **Mayo’s experimental reasoning theory** (Law 7), which emphasizes designing experiments that can distinguish competing theories and evaluate robustness under extreme conditions.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLMs, while impressive in their mathematical reasoning capabilities, are not robust to slight perturbations in problem statements. This fragility limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where mathematical problems often come in varied forms. By introducing adversarial training and self-verification, RobustMath aims to address this limitation and improve the robustness of LLMs. The Robustness Score provides a quantitative measure of LLM robustness, which is currently lacking in the field. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards at top conferences because it addresses a critical gap in the field, proposes a novel and comprehensive solution, and introduces new evaluation metrics that could become standard in future research.",
