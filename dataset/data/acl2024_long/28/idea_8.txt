    "Title": "MathExplain: Enhancing Interpretability of LLM Reasoning in Mathematical Problem Solving",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces MathExplain, a framework designed to enhance the interpretability of LLM reasoning in mathematical problem solving. MathExplain combines chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with explainable AI (XAI) techniques to generate not only the final answer but also a detailed explanation of the reasoning process. The framework uses a two-step process: (1) the LLM generates a reasoning path using CoT prompting, and (2) an XAI module analyzes the reasoning path to identify key decision points, logical dependencies, and potential errors. The XAI module then generates a human-readable explanation that highlights the reasoning steps and provides insights into how the final answer was derived. MathExplain also incorporates a feedback mechanism where users can interact with the explanations to refine the reasoning process, leading to iterative improvement over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. Glaser and Strauss’s theory is applied by using XAI techniques to ground the reasoning process in human-understandable explanations, making the LLM’s reasoning more transparent and interpretable. Laudan’s model is used to improve the existing chain-of-thought prompting method by adding an XAI layer that enhances the interpretability of the reasoning process. The combination of these theories allows us to propose a novel framework that not only improves the accuracy of LLMs but also makes their reasoning more transparent and trustworthy.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the observation that LLMs often produce reasoning paths that are difficult to interpret, as highlighted in the target paper. By introducing an XAI module, we can provide detailed explanations of the reasoning process, making it easier for users to understand and trust the LLM’s solutions. The feedback mechanism ensures that the LLM learns from user interactions, leading to continuous improvement. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in mathematical reasoning, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences.",
