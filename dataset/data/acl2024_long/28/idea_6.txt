    "Title": "MathVerifier: A Verification-Based Approach to Improve LLM Reasoning in Mathematical Problem Solving",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces MathVerifier, a verification-based approach to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in mathematical problem solving. MathVerifier employs a two-step process: (1) the LLM generates multiple candidate solutions using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and (2) a verifier model, trained on a dataset of correct and incorrect reasoning steps, evaluates the validity of each solution. The verifier model uses both syntactic and semantic checks to identify errors in reasoning, such as logical inconsistencies or incorrect calculations. The final output is the solution with the highest verification score. MathVerifier also incorporates a feedback loop where the LLM learns from the verifier’s corrections, enabling iterative improvement over time. This approach aims to address the brittleness of LLMs in mathematical reasoning by ensuring that only logically sound solutions are accepted.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Popper’s falsificationism** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. Popper’s falsificationism is applied by using the verifier model to systematically identify and reject incorrect reasoning steps, ensuring that only valid solutions are accepted. Laudan’s model is used to improve the existing chain-of-thought prompting method by adding a verification layer that enhances the reliability of the reasoning process. The combination of these theories allows us to propose a novel approach that not only improves the accuracy of LLMs but also ensures the logical consistency of their solutions.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the observation that LLMs often produce incorrect or inconsistent reasoning steps when solving mathematical problems, as highlighted in the target paper. By introducing a verification-based approach, we can systematically eliminate errors and improve the reliability of LLM-generated solutions. The feedback loop ensures that LLMs learn from their mistakes, leading to continuous improvement. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance the performance of LLMs in mathematical reasoning, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences.",
