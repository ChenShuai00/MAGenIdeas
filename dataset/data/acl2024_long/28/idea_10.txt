    "Title": "RobustMathNet: A Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Framework for Adversarial Mathematical Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hybrid neural-symbolic framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with symbolic reasoning engines to improve robustness in mathematical problem-solving. The framework, called RobustMathNet, combines the strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and pattern recognition with the precision and reliability of symbolic solvers. RobustMathNet uses a two-stage process: (1) LLMs generate initial reasoning steps and hypotheses, and (2) a symbolic reasoning engine verifies and refines these steps, ensuring correctness even under adversarial perturbations. The framework is evaluated on the GSM-Plus benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and accuracy compared to existing methods.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theory of **Construct and Modify Theoretical Models** (Quine’s holism, Kitcher’s unified theory of science). By combining neural and symbolic approaches, RobustMathNet addresses the limitations of LLMs in handling adversarial perturbations and provides a more reliable solution for mathematical reasoning. The hybrid framework leverages the complementary strengths of both paradigms, enabling more robust and interpretable reasoning. This approach also aligns with the theory of **Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings**, as it provides a new explanatory framework for addressing the anomalies observed in LLMs' performance on perturbed mathematical problems.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLMs, while powerful, often fail to generalize to adversarial or slightly modified mathematical problems. By integrating symbolic reasoning, RobustMathNet ensures that the reasoning process is both accurate and robust, even when faced with perturbations. This hybrid approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of mathematical reasoning in AI, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences.",
