    "Title": "MathEvolve: Evolutionary Algorithms for Enhancing LLM Reasoning in Mathematical Problem Solving",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes MathEvolve, a framework that uses evolutionary algorithms to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in mathematical problem solving. MathEvolve generates a population of reasoning paths for a given problem using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These reasoning paths are then subjected to evolutionary operations such as mutation (introducing small changes to the reasoning steps) and crossover (combining reasoning steps from different paths). A fitness function, based on the correctness and efficiency of the reasoning, is used to select the best paths for the next generation. Over multiple iterations, MathEvolve evolves increasingly accurate and efficient reasoning paths, leading to improved problem-solving performance. The framework also incorporates a diversity mechanism to ensure that the population of reasoning paths explores a wide range of potential solutions, reducing the risk of getting stuck in local optima.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem solving** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. Simon’s theory is applied by framing mathematical reasoning as a problem-solving process that can be optimized through evolutionary algorithms. Laudan’s model is used to improve the existing chain-of-thought prompting method by introducing evolutionary operations that enhance the diversity and quality of reasoning paths. The combination of these theories allows us to propose a novel framework that leverages evolutionary principles to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the observation that LLMs often produce suboptimal reasoning paths when solving mathematical problems, as highlighted in the target paper. By using evolutionary algorithms, we can systematically explore and optimize the space of possible reasoning paths, leading to more accurate and efficient solutions. The diversity mechanism ensures that the framework explores a wide range of potential solutions, reducing the risk of overfitting to specific problem types. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance the performance of LLMs in mathematical reasoning, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award at top conferences.",
