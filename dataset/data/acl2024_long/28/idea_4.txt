    "Title": "MathEvolve: A Framework for Evolutionary Training of LLMs for Robust Mathematical Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes MathEvolve, a framework that uses evolutionary algorithms to train LLMs for robust mathematical reasoning. MathEvolve introduces a novel evolutionary training process that iteratively generates and selects LLM variants based on their performance on a diverse set of mathematical problems, including those with perturbations. The framework includes a fitness function that evaluates the robustness of each LLM variant, as well as a mutation operator that introduces variations in the LLM’s reasoning process. MathEvolve is evaluated using a new benchmark, MathEvolveBench, which includes a wide range of mathematical problems with varying levels of complexity and perturbations.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s theory of crises and revolutions** (Law 10), which suggests that scientific paradigms can shift in response to accumulated anomalies. The observed fragility of LLMs in mathematical reasoning represents such an anomaly, and MathEvolve seeks to address it by introducing a new training paradigm based on evolutionary algorithms. The evolutionary training process is inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** (Law 2), which suggests that iterative problem-solving can lead to scientific discovery. The fitness function is designed using **Mayo’s experimental reasoning theory** (Law 7), which emphasizes designing experiments that can distinguish competing theories and evaluate robustness under extreme conditions. The mutation operator is inspired by **Feyerabend’s methodological anarchism** (Law 3), which advocates for exploring unconventional methods in scientific discovery.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current training methods for LLMs do not explicitly focus on robustness, leading to models that are fragile in the face of perturbations. MathEvolve addresses this limitation by introducing an evolutionary training process that explicitly selects for robustness. The fitness function ensures that only the most robust LLM variants are selected, while the mutation operator introduces variations that can lead to new and improved reasoning strategies. The new benchmark, MathEvolveBench, provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLM robustness in mathematical reasoning, which is currently lacking in the field. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards at top conferences because it introduces a novel evolutionary training framework that addresses a critical gap in the field and provides a new benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness.",
