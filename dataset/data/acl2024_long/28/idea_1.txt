    "Title": "MathReasonNet: A Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Framework for Robust Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes MathReasonNet, a hybrid neural-symbolic framework that combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to enhance the robustness of LLMs in mathematical reasoning. MathReasonNet integrates a neural component, which handles natural language understanding and problem decomposition, with a symbolic component, which performs precise mathematical calculations and logical reasoning. The framework also includes a novel error-correction mechanism that uses symbolic reasoning to detect and correct errors in the neural component’s output. MathReasonNet is trained on a diverse dataset of mathematical problems, including those with perturbations, to ensure robustness. The framework is evaluated using a new benchmark, MathReasonBench, which includes a wide range of mathematical problems with varying levels of complexity and perturbations.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** (Law 6), which emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to scientific discovery. MathReasonNet combines neural and symbolic reasoning, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to address the limitations of LLMs in mathematical reasoning. The error-correction mechanism is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (Law 8), which suggests that revisiting basic assumptions and developing auxiliary hypotheses can help explain and integrate anomalous findings. The hybrid framework is designed using **Quine’s holism** (Law 6), which advocates for a balance between reductionism and emergence in scientific theories. The evaluation benchmark, MathReasonBench, is developed using **Mayo’s experimental reasoning theory** (Law 7), which emphasizes designing experiments that can distinguish competing theories and evaluate robustness under extreme conditions.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current LLMs rely heavily on neural networks, which, while powerful, are not well-suited for precise mathematical reasoning. By integrating symbolic reasoning, MathReasonNet aims to address this limitation and improve the robustness of LLMs in mathematical tasks. The error-correction mechanism ensures that the neural component’s output is verified and corrected by the symbolic component, reducing the likelihood of errors. The new benchmark, MathReasonBench, provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLM robustness in mathematical reasoning, which is currently lacking in the field. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards at top conferences because it introduces a novel hybrid framework that addresses a critical gap in the field and provides a new benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness.",
