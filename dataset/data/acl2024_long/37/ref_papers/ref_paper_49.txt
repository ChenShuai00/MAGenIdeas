    "title": "Navigating the Grey Area: Expressions of Overconfidence and Uncertainty in Language Models",
    "abstract": "Despite increasingly \ufb02uent, relevant, and coherent language generation, major gaps remain between how humans and machines use language. We argue that a key dimension that is missing from our understanding of language models (LMs) is the model\u2019s ability to interpret and generate expressions of uncertainty . Whether it be the weatherperson announcing a chance of rain or a doctor giving a diagnosis, information is often not black-and-white and expressions of uncertainty provide nuance to support human-decision making. The increasing deployment of LMs in the wild motivates us to investigate whether LMs are capable of interpreting expressions of uncertainty and how LMs\u2019 behaviors change when learning to emit their own expressions of uncertainty. When injecting expressions of uncertainty into prompts (e.g., \"I think the answer is...\"), we discover that GPT3\u2019s generations vary upwards of 80% in accuracy based on the expression used. We analyze the linguistic characteristics of these expressions and \ufb01nd a drop in accuracy when naturalistic expressions of certainty are present. We \ufb01nd similar effects when teaching models to emit their own expressions of uncertainty, where model calibration suffers when teaching models to emit certainty rather than un certainty. Together, these results highlight the challenges of building LMs that interpret and generate trustworthy expressions of uncertainty."
