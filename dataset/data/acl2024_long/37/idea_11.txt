    "Title": "The Role of Linguistic Hedging in Mitigating Overconfidence in Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of linguistic hedging (e.g., phrases like 'I think,' 'possibly,' 'it seems') as a mechanism for LMs to express uncertainty more naturally and effectively. The research will investigate how different types of hedging phrases impact user trust and reliance on LM outputs. The study will involve: (1) developing a taxonomy of hedging phrases based on their strength and context of use, (2) training LMs to incorporate these phrases in their responses, and (3) conducting human experiments to evaluate the impact of hedging on user behavior and decision-making. The goal is to identify optimal hedging strategies that reduce overconfidence while maintaining user trust and engagement.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** and **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**. Pierce’s method involves analogical reasoning and creative leaps, which are used here to hypothesize that linguistic hedging can serve as a natural way for LMs to express uncertainty. Kuhn’s theory highlights the importance of exploring anomalies in existing paradigms, such as the current lack of effective uncertainty expression in LMs. The idea also draws on insights from the referenced paper on hedging detection in informal text, which provides a foundation for developing a taxonomy of hedging phrases.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper identifies the reluctance of LMs to express uncertainty and the human bias against uncertain texts. By leveraging linguistic hedging, this idea offers a practical and interpretable solution to these challenges. The proposed research has the potential to significantly improve the usability and trustworthiness of LMs in real-world applications, making it a strong candidate for publication in top conferences."
