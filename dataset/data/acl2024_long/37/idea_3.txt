    "Title": "Calibrating LMs for Cultural Contexts: A Framework for Context-Aware Uncertainty Expression",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework for calibrating LMs to express uncertainty in culturally appropriate ways. The framework involves training LMs on diverse datasets that include cultural variations in uncertainty expression, such as differences in hedging language and confidence markers across languages and regions. The system will dynamically adjust its uncertainty communication based on the user’s cultural context, ensuring that it aligns with local norms. The effectiveness of the framework will be evaluated through cross-cultural user studies measuring trust and comprehension.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes exploring the boundaries and scope of existing theories. The target paper highlights the global deployment of LMs, but current methods do not account for cultural differences in uncertainty expression. This idea addresses this gap by proposing a culturally aware framework. **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is used to integrate cultural context into LM training, while **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** is applied through analogical reasoning, drawing from cross-cultural communication theories.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that LMs are increasingly used globally, but their uncertainty communication is often culturally insensitive. By calibrating LMs for cultural contexts, we can improve their usability and trustworthiness in diverse settings. This idea is novel because it combines cultural studies with AI alignment, offering a solution that is both technically and socially impactful. The potential for winning awards lies in its interdisciplinary approach and its relevance to the global deployment of AI systems."
