    "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for LM Alignment",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a new approach to RLHF that explicitly incorporates uncertainty into the reward function. The approach includes: (1) a reward model that penalizes overconfident LM responses and rewards accurate uncertainty expression, (2) a dataset of human-annotated uncertainty preferences to train the reward model, and (3) a fine-tuning pipeline that integrates uncertainty-aware RLHF into LM training. The approach will be evaluated on tasks like conversational AI and content moderation, where uncertainty communication is critical.",
    "Thinking": "This idea draws on **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (Law 4) to improve RLHF by integrating uncertainty awareness. It also uses **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (Law 2) to hypothesize that uncertainty-aware RLHF will lead to better-aligned LMs. The target paper’s finding that LMs are overconfident despite human feedback motivates this idea.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper highlights the limitations of current RLHF methods in addressing LM overconfidence. This idea directly addresses this limitation by incorporating uncertainty into the reward function, leading to better-aligned LMs. The potential to improve LM safety and trustworthiness makes this idea highly impactful and suitable for a best paper award."
