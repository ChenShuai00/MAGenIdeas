    "Title": "Human-Centered Calibration: Aligning Language Model Confidence with User Expectations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a human-centered approach to calibrating LM confidence scores. The research will focus on understanding how users interpret and respond to different levels of confidence expressed by LMs. The study will involve: (1) collecting user feedback on LM confidence expressions across various domains, (2) developing a user-specific calibration model that adjusts LM confidence scores based on individual user preferences and risk tolerance, and (3) evaluating the impact of personalized calibration on user trust and decision-making. The goal is to create LMs that adapt their confidence expressions to align with the expectations and needs of individual users.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**. Laudan’s model emphasizes the importance of improving existing methods by integrating new tools and perspectives, which is reflected in the proposed user-specific calibration approach. Whewell’s theory suggests identifying common patterns across multiple studies, which is applied here to synthesize insights from human feedback and LM behavior. The idea also draws on the referenced paper on human-AI team performance, which highlights the importance of aligning AI behavior with human expectations.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper highlights the disconnect between LM confidence expressions and user behavior, particularly the tendency of users to rely on LM outputs regardless of their certainty. By developing a human-centered calibration model, this idea addresses this disconnect and improves the alignment between LM behavior and user expectations. The personalized approach has the potential to significantly enhance user trust and decision-making, making it a compelling contribution to the field of human-AI interaction."
