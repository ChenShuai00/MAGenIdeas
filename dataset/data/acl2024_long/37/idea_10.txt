    "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Language Models: A Framework for Calibrated Confidence and Human-AI Trust",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel framework for training and evaluating language models to express calibrated uncertainty in their responses. The framework integrates uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Bayesian methods and ensemble-based confidence scoring, with human feedback to ensure that LMs not only express uncertainty but also do so in a way that aligns with human expectations. The framework includes: (1) a new training objective that penalizes overconfidence and rewards well-calibrated uncertainty expressions, (2) a human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism to refine uncertainty expressions, and (3) a set of evaluation metrics to assess the calibration of uncertainty in real-world applications. The goal is to create LMs that can reliably communicate their confidence levels, thereby improving trust and decision-making in human-AI collaboration.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Popper’s falsificationism** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. Popper’s emphasis on identifying deviations between theoretical predictions and experimental results aligns with the need to detect and correct overconfidence in LMs. Laudan’s model suggests improving existing methods by integrating new technologies and tools, which is reflected in the proposed framework's use of Bayesian methods and human feedback. The idea also draws on **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** to abstract general principles from multiple studies on LM calibration and human trust.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper highlights the risks of LM overconfidence and the human tendency to rely on LM outputs regardless of their certainty. This framework addresses these issues by ensuring that LMs are not only capable of expressing uncertainty but also do so in a way that is meaningful and trustworthy to humans. By incorporating human feedback and rigorous evaluation metrics, the framework bridges the gap between LM behavior and human expectations, making it a strong candidate for impactful research in human-AI interaction."
