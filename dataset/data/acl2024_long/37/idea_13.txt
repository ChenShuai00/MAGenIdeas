    "Title": "Exploring the Impact of Uncertainty Expression on Human-AI Collaboration in High-Stakes Domains",
    "Idea": "This idea investigates how different methods of uncertainty expression by LMs impact human-AI collaboration in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. The research will compare the effectiveness of verbalized uncertainty (e.g., 'I am 80% confident') versus numerical confidence scores (e.g., '80%') in influencing user trust and decision-making. The study will involve: (1) designing experiments to test the impact of different uncertainty expression methods in simulated high-stakes scenarios, (2) analyzing user behavior and decision outcomes, and (3) developing guidelines for optimal uncertainty expression in high-stakes applications. The goal is to identify the most effective ways for LMs to communicate uncertainty in contexts where errors can have serious consequences.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Popper’s falsificationism** and **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**. Popper’s emphasis on testing hypotheses through experimentation aligns with the proposed experimental design to evaluate different uncertainty expression methods. Kuhn’s theory highlights the importance of exploring anomalies in existing paradigms, such as the current lack of effective uncertainty expression in high-stakes domains. The idea also draws on the referenced paper on human-AI team performance, which underscores the importance of aligning AI behavior with human expectations in collaborative settings.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper highlights the risks of LM overconfidence and the human tendency to rely on LM outputs regardless of their certainty. By exploring the impact of different uncertainty expression methods in high-stakes domains, this idea addresses a critical gap in the literature and provides actionable insights for improving human-AI collaboration. The research has the potential to significantly enhance the safety and reliability of LMs in high-stakes applications, making it a strong candidate for publication in top conferences."
