    "Title": "Calibrating Confidence: A Framework for Training Language Models to Express Uncertainty Accurately",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel framework for training language models to express uncertainty in a calibrated manner. The framework integrates human feedback during training to ensure that LMs not only verbalize uncertainty but also align their confidence levels with the actual likelihood of correctness. The framework includes: (1) a new loss function that penalizes overconfidence and rewards accurate uncertainty expression, (2) a dataset of human-annotated uncertainty expressions to fine-tune LMs, and (3) a post-hoc calibration module that adjusts LM confidence scores based on real-world performance. The framework will be evaluated on tasks like medical diagnosis and legal advice, where accurate uncertainty communication is critical.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (Law 4), which emphasizes improving existing methods by integrating new tools and techniques. The framework addresses the target paper’s finding that LMs are overconfident and proposes a systematic way to improve their calibration. Additionally, **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (Law 8) is used to explain why users over-rely on LMs despite their overconfidence, and the framework incorporates mechanisms to mitigate this behavior.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper highlights the risks of LM overconfidence and the lack of user awareness of LM uncertainty. This framework directly addresses these issues by improving LM calibration and providing users with more reliable confidence estimates. The integration of human feedback ensures that the framework is aligned with user needs, making it highly practical and impactful. The potential to improve trust and safety in high-stakes applications makes this idea a strong candidate for a best paper award."
