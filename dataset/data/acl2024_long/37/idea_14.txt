    "Title": "A Multi-Modal Approach to Uncertainty Expression in Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-modal approach to uncertainty expression in LMs, combining verbalized confidence, visual indicators (e.g., color-coded confidence levels), and interactive elements (e.g., sliders for adjusting confidence thresholds). The research will investigate how multi-modal uncertainty expression impacts user trust, reliance, and decision-making. The study will involve: (1) designing a multi-modal interface for LM uncertainty expression, (2) conducting user experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the interface, and (3) developing guidelines for integrating multi-modal uncertainty expression into real-world applications. The goal is to create LMs that communicate uncertainty in a way that is intuitive, engaging, and trustworthy for users.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** and **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**. Laudan’s model emphasizes the importance of integrating new technologies and tools to improve existing methods, which is reflected in the proposed multi-modal approach. Whewell’s theory suggests identifying common patterns across multiple studies, which is applied here to synthesize insights from human feedback and LM behavior. The idea also draws on the referenced paper on human-AI team performance, which highlights the importance of aligning AI behavior with human expectations.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper highlights the limitations of current methods for uncertainty expression in LMs and the human tendency to rely on LM outputs regardless of their certainty. By proposing a multi-modal approach, this idea addresses these limitations and provides a more intuitive and engaging way for LMs to communicate uncertainty. The research has the potential to significantly improve user trust and decision-making, making it a compelling contribution to the field of human-AI interaction."
