    "Title": "The Role of Cultural and Linguistic Diversity in LM Uncertainty Expression",
    "Idea": "This idea investigates how cultural and linguistic diversity affects the way LMs express uncertainty. The study will: (1) collect datasets of uncertainty expressions from diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, (2) analyze how current LMs perform across these contexts, and (3) propose modifications to LM training pipelines to better handle diversity in uncertainty expression. The study will also explore how users from different cultural backgrounds interpret LM uncertainty and how this affects their trust and reliance on LMs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewellâ€™s conceptual synthesis theory** (Law 5), which emphasizes identifying common patterns across multiple studies. The target paper focuses on English-language LMs, but uncertainty expression varies widely across cultures and languages. By synthesizing insights from diverse contexts, this idea aims to uncover general principles for improving LM uncertainty communication.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper highlights the importance of uncertainty communication in human-AI interaction, but it does not address cultural and linguistic diversity. This idea fills a critical gap by exploring how diversity affects LM behavior and user trust. The potential to make LMs more inclusive and globally applicable makes this idea highly novel and impactful."
