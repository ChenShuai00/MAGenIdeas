    "Title": "Uncertainty as a Feature: Leveraging LM Uncertainty for Better Human-AI Collaboration",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes treating uncertainty as a feature rather than a flaw in LMs. By developing a system that explicitly highlights uncertain outputs and provides alternative suggestions, users can make more informed decisions. The system will include a 'confidence dashboard' that visualizes the LM’s confidence levels across different parts of its response, along with explanations for why certain parts are uncertain. The system will be tested in collaborative tasks, such as writing assistance and code autocomplete, to measure its impact on user trust and task performance.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s theory of crises and revolutions**, which suggests that anomalies in existing paradigms can lead to new scientific breakthroughs. The target paper identifies the anomaly of LMs being reluctant to express uncertainty, and this idea reframes uncertainty as a valuable feature. **Laudan’s problem-solving model** is used to propose a hypothesis (uncertainty as a feature) that addresses the gap in current LM behavior. Additionally, **Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory** is applied to construct a conceptual framework for integrating uncertainty into human-AI collaboration.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that uncertainty, when communicated effectively, can enhance human-AI collaboration by providing users with more nuanced information. Current systems often hide uncertainty, leading to over-reliance on incorrect outputs. By making uncertainty explicit, this system empowers users to make better decisions. The idea is innovative because it challenges the prevailing view of uncertainty as a problem and instead positions it as a tool for improving collaboration. This idea has the potential to win awards because it offers a paradigm shift in how we think about LM uncertainty and its role in human-AI interaction."
