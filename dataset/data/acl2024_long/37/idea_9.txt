    "Title": "The Psychology of Uncertainty: How Human Biases Affect LM Uncertainty Communication",
    "Idea": "This idea explores how human cognitive biases (e.g., overconfidence bias, confirmation bias) affect the way users interpret LM uncertainty. The study will: (1) conduct experiments to measure how users interpret LM uncertainty under different conditions, (2) identify biases that lead to misinterpretation of LM confidence, and (3) propose interventions (e.g., debiasing techniques, educational prompts) to improve user understanding of LM uncertainty. The study will also explore how these biases vary across different user demographics.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (Law 8), which emphasizes explaining anomalous user behaviors. The target paper shows that users often over-rely on LMs despite their uncertainty, suggesting that cognitive biases play a role. The idea also draws on **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (Law 1) to explore the boundaries of current theories on LM uncertainty communication.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper highlights the risks of user over-reliance on LMs, but it does not explore the psychological factors behind this behavior. This idea fills a critical gap by investigating how cognitive biases affect LM uncertainty communication. The potential to improve user trust and decision-making makes this idea highly impactful and novel."
