    "Title": "Teaching LMs to Hedge: A Linguistic Approach to Uncertainty Expression",
    "Idea": "This idea explores training language models to use hedging language (e.g., 'I think,' 'possibly,' 'it seems') to express uncertainty in a way that aligns with human communication norms. The approach involves creating a dataset of human-annotated examples where hedging is used appropriately, followed by fine-tuning LMs using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The goal is to make LMs more linguistically calibrated, ensuring that their verbalized uncertainty matches their actual confidence levels. The effectiveness of this approach will be evaluated through human experiments measuring trust, reliance, and decision-making accuracy.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which focuses on improving existing methods by integrating new tools and techniques. The target paper identifies the limitation of LMs being overconfident, and this idea proposes a linguistic solution to address it. Additionally, **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** is applied through creative leaps, drawing inspiration from linguistic theories of hedging and conversational management. The use of RLHF aligns with **Hacking’s experimental system theory**, which emphasizes iterative refinement through experimentation.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the observation that humans naturally use hedging to express uncertainty, but LMs do not. By teaching LMs to hedge, we can make their uncertainty communication more intuitive and trustworthy. This approach is novel because it combines linguistic theory with machine learning techniques, offering a human-centered solution to a technical problem. The potential impact is significant, as it could improve the usability of LMs in applications like customer service, education, and healthcare. This idea is award-worthy because it bridges the gap between linguistics and AI, offering a fresh perspective on LM alignment."
