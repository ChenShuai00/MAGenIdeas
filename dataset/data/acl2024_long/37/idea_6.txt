    "Title": "Uncertainty as a Feature: Designing User Interfaces to Highlight LM Uncertainty in Decision-Making",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the design of user interfaces (UIs) that explicitly highlight LM uncertainty to improve human decision-making. The UI design includes: (1) visual cues (e.g., color-coded confidence levels) to indicate LM uncertainty, (2) interactive elements that allow users to explore alternative answers based on LM confidence, and (3) explanations of how the LM arrived at its confidence estimate. The UI will be tested in a controlled study to measure its impact on user trust, reliance, and decision accuracy in tasks like financial planning and medical diagnosis.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (Law 1), which encourages exploring the boundaries of existing theories. The target paper identifies an anomaly where users over-rely on LMs despite their uncertainty, suggesting a need for new paradigms in UI design. The idea also draws on **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (Law 2) to hypothesize that explicit uncertainty visualization will improve user decision-making.",
    "Rationale": "The target paper shows that users often ignore LM uncertainty, leading to poor decisions. By making uncertainty a central feature of the UI, this idea aims to bridge the gap between LM behavior and user understanding. The potential to improve decision-making in high-stakes domains makes this idea highly impactful and worthy of a best paper award."
