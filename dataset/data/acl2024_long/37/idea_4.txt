    "Title": "Uncertainty in the Loop: A Human-in-the-Loop Framework for LM Confidence Refinement",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a human-in-the-loop framework where users can provide feedback on LM confidence levels, enabling iterative refinement of uncertainty estimates. The system will prompt users to rate the LM’s confidence in its responses and provide explanations for their ratings. This feedback will be used to fine-tune the LM’s confidence calibration, creating a continuous improvement loop. The framework will be tested in applications like medical diagnosis and legal advice, where accurate uncertainty communication is critical.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which focuses on improving methods through iterative refinement. The target paper identifies the problem of LM overconfidence, and this idea proposes a human-in-the-loop solution. **Hacking’s experimental system theory** is applied to design the feedback loop, ensuring that the system evolves based on user input. Additionally, **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** is used to creatively integrate human feedback into the LM training process.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that human feedback is essential for refining LM confidence estimates, especially in high-stakes applications. Current methods for confidence calibration are static and do not adapt to user needs. By incorporating human feedback, this framework ensures that LM uncertainty communication is both accurate and user-centered. The idea is innovative because it leverages human expertise to improve AI systems, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards due to its practical impact and interdisciplinary approach."
