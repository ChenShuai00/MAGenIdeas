    "title": "Discovering New Intents Using Latent Variables",
    "abstract": "Discovering new intents is of great significance to establishing Bootstrapped Task-Oriented Dialogue System. Most existing methods either lack the ability to transfer prior knowledge in the known intent data or fall into the dilemma of forgetting prior knowledge in the follow-up. More importantly, these methods do not deeply explore the intrinsic structure of unlabeled data, so they can not seek out the characteristics that make an intent in general. In this paper, starting from the intuition that discovering intents could be beneficial to the identification of the known intents, we propose a probabilistic framework for discovering intents where intent assignments are treated as latent variables. We adopt Expectation Maximization framework for optimization. Specifically, In E-step, we conduct discovering intents and explore the intrinsic structure of unlabeled data by the posterior of intent assignments. In M-step, we alleviate the forgetting of prior knowledge transferred from known intents by optimizing the discrimination of labeled data. Extensive experiments conducted in three challenging real-world datasets demonstrate our method can achieve substantial improvements."
