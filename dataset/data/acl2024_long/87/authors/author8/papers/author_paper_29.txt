    "abstract": "Gradient-based adversarial training is widely used in improving the robustness of neural networks, while it cannot be easily adapted to natural language processing tasks since the embedding space is discrete.\nIn natural language processing fields, virtual adversarial training is introduced since texts are discrete and cannot be perturbed by gradients directly. \nAlternatively, virtual adversarial training, which generates perturbations on the embedding space, is introduced in NLP tasks.\nDespite its success, existing virtual adversarial training methods generate perturbations roughly constrained by Frobenius normalization balls.\nTo craft fine-grained perturbations, we propose a Token-Aware Virtual Adversarial Training method.\nWe introduce a token-level accumulated perturbation vocabulary to initialize the perturbations better and use a token-level normalization ball to constrain these perturbations pertinently.\nExperiments show that our method improves the performance of pre-trained models such as BERT and ALBERT in various tasks by a considerable margin.\nThe proposed method improves the score of the GLUE benchmark from 78.3 to 80.9 using BERT model and it also enhances the performance of sequence labeling and text classification tasks."
