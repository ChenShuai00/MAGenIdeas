    "title": "Unveiling and Consulting Core Experts in Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLMs",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improved the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve knowledge-intensive tasks. While existing research seeks to enhance RAG performance by retrieving higher-quality documents or designing RAG-specific LLMs, the internal mechanisms within LLMs that contribute to RAG\u2019s effectiveness remain underexplored. In this paper, we aim to investigate these internal mechanisms within the popular Mixture-of-Expert (MoE)-based LLMs and demonstrate how to improve RAG by examining expert activations in these LLMs. Our controlled experiments reveal that several core groups of experts are primarily responsible for RAG-related behaviors. The activation of these core experts can signify the model\u2019s inclination towards external/internal knowledge and adjust its behavior. For instance, we identify core experts that can (1) indicate the sufficiency of the model\u2019s internal knowledge, (2) assess the quality of retrieved documents, and (3) enhance the model\u2019s ability to utilize context. Based on these findings, we propose several strategies to enhance RAG\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness through expert activation. Experimental results across various datasets and MoE LLMs show the effectiveness of our method."
