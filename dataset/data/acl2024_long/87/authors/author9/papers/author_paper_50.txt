    "title": "A Unified Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Dependency Parsing",
    "abstract": "Chinese word segmentation and dependency parsing are two fundamental tasks for Chinese natural language processing. The dependency parsing is defined on word-level, therefore word segmentation is the precondition of dependency parsing, which makes dependency parsing suffers from error propagation. In this paper, we propose a unified model to integrate Chinese word segmentation and dependency parsing. Different from previous joint models, our proposed model is a graph-based model and more concise, which results in fewer efforts of feature engineering. Our joint model achieves better performance than previous joint models. Our joint model achieves the state-of-the-art results in both Chinese word segmentation and dependency parsing."
