    "title": "Mitigating Reward Hacking via Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking , also termed reward overoptimization , remains a critical challenge, which primarily stems from limitations in reward modeling, i.e., generalizability of the reward model and inconsistency in the preference dataset. In this work, we tackle this problem from an information-theoretic perspective, and propose a generalizable and robust framework for reward modeling, namely InfoRM , by introducing a variational information bottleneck objective to filter out irrelevant information and developing a mechanism for model complexity modulation. Notably, we further identify a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the latent space, establishing InfoRM as a promising tool for detecting reward overoptimization. Inspired by this finding, we propose the Integrated Cluster Deviation Score (ICDS), which quantifies deviations in the latent space, as an indicator of reward overoptimization to facilitate the development of online mitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on a wide range of settings and model scales (70M, 440M, 1.4B, and 7B) support the effectiveness of InfoRM . Further analyses reveal that InfoRM \u2019s overoptimization detection mechanism is effective, potentially signifying a notable advancement in the field of RLHF. Code will be released upon acceptance."
