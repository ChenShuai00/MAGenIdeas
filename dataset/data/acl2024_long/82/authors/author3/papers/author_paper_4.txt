    "title": "Can LLMs Learn Uncertainty on Their Own? Expressing Uncertainty Effectively in A Self-Training Manner",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit excessive, random, and uninformative uncertainty, rendering them unsuitable for decision-making in human-computer interactions. In this paper, we aim to instigate a heightened awareness of self-uncertainty in LLMs, enabling them to express uncertainty more effectively. To accomplish this, we propose an uncertainty-aware instruction tuning (UaIT) method, aligning LLMs\u2019 perception with the probabilistic uncertainty of the generation. We conducted experiments using LLaMA2 and Mistral on multiple free-form QA tasks. Experimental results revealed a surprising 45.2% improvement in the effectiveness of uncertainty expression by LLMs, accompanied by reasonably good out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Moreover, this uncertainty expression can serve as a valuable real-time basis for human decision-making, e.g., retrieving external documents and incorporating stronger LLMs."
