    "title": "DRPruning: Efficient Large Language Model Pruning through Distributionally Robust Optimization",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results but face challenges from increasing model sizes and computational costs. Structured pruning reduces model size and speeds up inference but often causes uneven degradation across domains, leading to biased performance. To address this, we propose DRPruning, which incorporates distributionally robust optimization to restore balanced performance across domains, along with further improvements to enhance robustness. Experiments in monolingual and multilingual settings show that our method surpasses similarly sized models in pruning and continued pretraining over perplexity, downstream tasks, and instruction tuning. We further provide analysis demonstrating the robustness of our method towards various domains and distribution shifts. Furthermore, our method automatically determines optimal reference losses and data ratios, suggesting potential for broader applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/hexuandeng/DRPruning."
