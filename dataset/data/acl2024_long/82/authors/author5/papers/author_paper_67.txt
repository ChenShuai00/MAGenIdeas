    "title": "Task-technology Fit Aware Expectation-confirmation Model towards Understanding of MOOCs Continued Usage Intention",
    "abstract": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been playing a pivotal role among the latest e-learning ini-tiative and obtain widespread popularity in many uni-versities. But the low course completion rate and the high midway dropout rate of students have puzzled some researchers and designers of MOOCs. Therefore, it is important to exp lore the factors affecting students\u2019 continuance intention to use MOOCs. This study integrates task-technology fit which can explain how the characteristics of task and technology affect the outcome of technology utilization into expectation-confirmation model to analyze the factors influencing students\u2019 keeping using MOOCs and the relationships of constructs in the model, then it will also extend our understandings of continuance intention about MOOCs. We analyze and study 234 respondents, and results reveal that perceived usefulness, satisfaction and task-technology fit are important precedents of the intention to continue using MOOCs. Researchers and designers of MOOCs may obtain further insight in continuance intention about MOOCs."
