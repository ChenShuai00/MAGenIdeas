    "title": "Traceable Air Baggage Handling System Based on RFID Tags in the Airport",
    "abstract": "The RFID is not only a feasible, novel, and cost-effective candidate for daily object identification but it is also considered as a significant tool to provide traceable visibility along different stages of the aviation supply chain. In the air baggage handing application, the RFID tags are used to enhance the ability for baggage tracking, dispatching and conveyance so as to improve the management efficiency and the users' satisfaction. We surveyed current related work and introduce the IATA RP1740c protocol used for the standard to recognize the baggage tags. One distributed aviation baggage traceable application is designed based on the RFID networks. We describe the RFID-based baggage tracking experiment in the BCIA (Beijing Capital International Airport). In this experiment the tags are sealed in the printed baggage label and the RFID readers are fixed in the certain interested positions of the BHS in the Terminal 2. We measure the accurate recognition rate and monitor the baggage's real-time situation on the monitor's screen. Through the analysis of the measured results within two months we emphasize the advantage of the adoption of RFID tags in this high noisy BHS environment. The economical benefits achieved by the extensive deployment of RFID in the baggage handing system are also outlined."
