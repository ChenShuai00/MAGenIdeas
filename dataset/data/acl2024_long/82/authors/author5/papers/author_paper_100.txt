    "abstract": "Sentiment Classification of web reviews or comments is an important and challenging task in Web Mining and Data Mining. This paper presents a novel approach using association rules for sentiment classification of web re- views. A new restraint measure AD-Sup is used to extract discriminative fre- quent term sets and eliminate terms with no sentiment orientation which contain close frequency in both positive and negative reviews. An optimal classification rule set is then generated which abandons the redundant general rule with lower confidence than the specific one. In the class label prediction procedure, we proposed a new metric voting scheme to solve the problem when the covered rules are not adequately confident or not applicable. The final score of a test re- view depends on the overall contributions of four metrics. Extensive experi- ments on multiple domain datasets from web site demonstrate that 50% is the best min-conf to guarantee classification rules both abundant and persuasive and the voting strategy obtains improvements on other baselines of using confi- dence. Another comparison to popular machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes and kNN also indicates that the proposed method outper- forms these strong benchmarks."
