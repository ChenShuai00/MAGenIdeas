    "title": "A Scalable RFID-Based System for Location-Aware Services",
    "abstract": "Location-awareness is a crucial trait of the mobile computing applications. The RFID is not only a feasible, novel, and cost-effective candidate for the indoor location sensing but also considered as the bridge which can merge physical world with hyperspace. Our study focuses on a location-aware computing architecture which provides the scalable location-based services for tracking nearly all daily objects by utilizing the RFID tags. The paper presents a hierarchical structure to organize the position areas based on tracking zone of interest (TZOI). Because the context is vital for mobile computing and can enable the revolution in computing model, a method of managing the location-centric context record is brought forward. We further propose an approach to aware the object's intentions and requirements which are varying over location by tracing and matching these records. An original application experimenting on the baggage handling in the airport also demonstrates the location awareness, e.g., when the baggage has been automatically sorted and arrives the correct place, one SMS is delivered to the owner's mobile phone to remind him."
