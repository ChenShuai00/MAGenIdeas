    "abstract": "The convergence of information technology and diverse business requirements is making the organization information systems more complex. Quickly integrating existing systems and developing new applications to serve the requirement of flexible business environments have become a key factor for organizations to gain a competitive edge. To meet this challenge, the concept of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been proposed and widely lauded as an innovative business oriented solution. To better utilize SOA's advantages, several research problems should be attached much importance among which service lifecycle management is a notable one, which is one of the critical mechanisms leading to higher service quality. A large number of service lifecycle models have been proposed in the literature while few of them clearly indicate the integration of the lifecycle processes with stakeholders. In this research, a conceptual stakeholder identification and analysis framework is proposed by which stakeholders are analyzed within different service lifecycle stages. It is believed that this method can offer the researchers in the community further insight into service lifecycle management from the stakeholder's perspective."
