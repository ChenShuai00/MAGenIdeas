    "title": "MAKT: Multichannel Attention Networks based Knowledge Tracing with Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "As an effective and emerging component of intelligent education, Knowledge Tracing(KT) achieves the combination of artificial intelligence and individualized learning, whose aim is to assess students\u2019 mastery of knowledge concepts and assist in developing learning plans. Several existing KT models either use concepts sequence as input and evaluate students\u2019 knowledge state or treat exercise as input to predict students\u2019 future performance. In this paper, we introduce a constraint factor to extract concepts\u2019 and exercises\u2019 relation matrix, design three methods in representation learning, and propose a Multichannel Attention Networks based KT model(MAKT). Specifically, we restrict the co-occurrence relationship within a time window to extract the relation matrix and then train their representations via graph generative learning, graph contrastive learning, and matrix decomposition, respectively. In MAKT, a sliding window is implemented by multichannel where input sequence is sequentially lagged in turn by one position and attention mechanism is applied. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that MAKT with concepts\u2019 and exercises\u2019 representation trained by matrix decomposition outperforms state-of-the-art models."
