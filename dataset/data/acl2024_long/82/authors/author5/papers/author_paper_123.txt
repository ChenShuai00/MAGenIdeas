    "title": "Research on lightweight RFID Reader Protocol",
    "abstract": "Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a kind of widely used contactless automatic recognition technology. Large-scale deployment of RFID readers and tags provides a very good hardware foundation for ubiquitous computing. A typical RFID system is usually composed of four parts: tag, RFID reader, RFID middleware and application system. To make the RFID reader integration uniform and effective, and meet the low calculation requirement of low-cost readers, a lightweight RFID reader protocol is presented. Considering the EPC standard has become a virtual standard of RFID system due to its rapid development, to meet the demand of EPC reader protocol standard (RPS), the presented protocol is specified in three layers, respectively the reader layer, the messaging layer and the transport layer. Differ from EPC RPS, in which different Messaging/Transport Bindings provide for different kinds of transport, the Messaging Layer and the Transport Layer are no longer designed to be working in pairs. Fieldbus technologies (especially PROFIBUS) are used for reference in the implementation of the transport layer."
