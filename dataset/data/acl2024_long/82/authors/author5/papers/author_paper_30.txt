    "title": "Multi-Modal Contrastive Pre-training for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Personalized recommendation plays a central role in various online applications. To provide quality recommendation service, it is of crucial importance to consider multi-modal information associated with users and items, e.g., review text, description text, and images. However, many existing approaches do not fully explore and fuse multiple modalities. To address this problem, we propose a multi-modal contrastive pre-training model for recommendation. We first construct a homogeneous item graph and a user graph based on the relationship of co-interaction. For users, we propose intra-modal aggregation and inter-modal aggregation to fuse review texts and the structural information of the user graph. For items, we consider three modalities: description text, images, and item graph. Moreover, the description text and image complement each other for the same item. One of them can be used as promising supervision for the other. Therefore, to capture this signal and better exploit the potential correlation of intra-modalities, we propose a self-supervised contrastive inter-modal alignment task to make the textual and visual modalities as similar as possible. Then, we apply inter-modal aggregation to obtain the multi-modal representation of items. Next, we employ a binary cross-entropy loss function to capture the potential correlation between users and items. Finally, we fine-tune the pre-trained multi-modal representations using an existing recommendation model. We have performed extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Experimental results verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method."
