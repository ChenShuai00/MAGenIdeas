    "title": "Influencing Factors Analysis of People's Answering Behaviours on Social Network Based Questions",
    "abstract": "Recently the social question/answering systems have become a natural way for people to get information from their social connections. Despite its popularity in knowledge sharing, its development still faces several challenges, among which a notable one is that a majority of questions get no response. How to improve the response ratio and reduce the number of unanswered social questions has become a challenging problem. Though some research in this context has been well studied, intrinsic factors that reveal profiles of social answerers are still less understood. In this paper, we try to discover: what kind of person is likely to be an answerer? To answer this question, we study multiple hypothetical factors from the perspectives of social and personal analysis. A set of experiments are conducted to identify the relationship between these factors and the action of answering. We present a comprehensive description alongside our analysis of behavioural patterns of answerers in the scenario of social information seeking."
