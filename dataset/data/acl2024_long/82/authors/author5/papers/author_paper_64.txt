    "abstract": "The information literacy that the teenagers should have is widely concerned nowadays. We have been teaching a course entitled Introduction to Computer Science and computer Ethics that is taken by freshmen from computer science, electronic engineering and software engineering. There were more than 400 students in our course annually. The students were divided into groups to participate the in-class discussion. We used to focus on computer professional code of practice in last years. While in the fall semester 2017, we paid more attention on what computer and internet have bring us, and what should we do when we are facing the situations nobody had met before. There were 4 sessions, respectively great changes in society made by computer technology and internet, influences in our traditional culture, responsibility of enterprise in information age, and the artificial intelligent ethics problems. Most topics include new technology or idea. We got over 300 questionnaires after the course finished. From which we found that, compare with the former students, more moral topics have been closely followed. Nowadays, all society members are the contributors of the internet, whatever their major are. Our approach can be spread to similar information entrance course easily."
