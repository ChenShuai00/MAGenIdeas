    "title": "On Design of Mobile Agent Based Location Service for Geographic Routing",
    "abstract": "On the impact of the node mobility, location service approaches based on the node location management incur high protocol overhead and low validity of location information. Therefore, a mobile location agent (MLA) algorithm is introduced to optimize location service. For each node, a location agent will be used to perform the location update and query by location service to decrease the protocol overhead. The location agent will assist the packet routing to the destination, which will upgrade the validity of location information caching in the network and improve the performance of geographic routing. When analyzing routing according to the location agent, we show a new method traversing all local closest nodes around a void location agent region to obtain the location information of the destination node. We select representative location service protocols and perform MLA algorithm. Simulation experimental results show that MLA algorithm can significantly reduce the protocol overhead of location service and improve the packet delivery ratio of geographic routing effectively."
