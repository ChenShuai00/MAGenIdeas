    "Title": "Format-Following in Low-Resource Domains: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Adaptability",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a new benchmark called Format-Following in Low-Resource Domains (FFLRD), which evaluates LLMs' ability to follow formats in domains with limited training data. The benchmark will include tasks from domains such as indigenous languages, rare medical conditions, and niche legal areas, where annotated data is scarce. The tasks will be designed to assess the LLM's ability to generalize from limited data, as well as its ability to adapt to new formats with minimal supervision. The benchmark will be developed using a combination of real-world data and synthetic data generation, ensuring a wide range of low-resource domains. The evaluation will focus on the LLM's accuracy in following the formats, as well as its ability to maintain coherence and relevance in its responses.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions and Hall’s dynamic system theory, which emphasize the importance of adaptability and resilience in scientific models. By evaluating LLMs' ability to perform in low-resource domains, we address a significant gap in current benchmarks, which typically focus on high-resource domains. The idea also leverages Laudan’s methodological improvement model by improving experimental design (e.g., low-resource tasks) and developing new data analysis methods (e.g., few-shot learning metrics).",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that real-world applications of LLMs often involve domains with limited training data, where formats can be highly specialized and difficult to generalize. A benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to perform in low-resource domains is crucial for ensuring their practical utility in a wide range of applications. FFLRD will provide a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' format-following capabilities, leading to better models that can handle low-resource scenarios. This idea has the potential to win best paper awards because it addresses a critical gap in LLM evaluation, proposes an innovative solution, and has broad applicability across various domains."
