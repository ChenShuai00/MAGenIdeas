    "Title": "Format-Following as a Transferable Skill: Cross-Domain Evaluation of LLMs",
    "Idea": "This research investigates whether format-following capability is a transferable skill across domains. For example, can an LLM trained to follow legal document formats also follow medical report formats? The study will evaluate LLMs on a cross-domain format-following benchmark and explore techniques such as domain adaptation and meta-learning to improve transferability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method and Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving. We hypothesize that format-following is a generalizable skill and test this hypothesis through cross-domain evaluation. If proven, this could lead to more efficient training methods for LLMs.",
    "Rationale": "If format-following is transferable across domains, it would reduce the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, making LLMs more versatile and cost-effective. This research could lead to breakthroughs in multi-domain AI applications."
