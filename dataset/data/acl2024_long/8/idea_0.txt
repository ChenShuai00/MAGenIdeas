    "Title": "FormatGen: A Generative Framework for Domain-Specific Format Creation and Adaptation in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This paper proposes FormatGen, a generative framework that enables LLMs to autonomously create and adapt domain-specific formats. The framework leverages a combination of unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning to generate formats that are both syntactically correct and semantically meaningful for specific domains (e.g., legal documents, medical records). FormatGen also includes a feedback loop where human experts can refine the generated formats, ensuring high-quality outputs. The framework is evaluated on a diverse set of domains, and the results show that it significantly improves LLMs' ability to follow complex formats, outperforming existing benchmarks like FoFo. The paper also explores the impact of format adaptation on downstream tasks, such as document summarization and question answering, demonstrating that improved format-following leads to better task performance.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Methodology 1: Define New Scientific Problems** (Kuhn’s paradigm theory) and **Methodology 4: Design and Improve Existing Methods** (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). The target paper identifies a gap in evaluating LLMs' format-following capabilities, which aligns with Kuhn’s theory of identifying anomalies in existing paradigms. FormatGen addresses this gap by proposing a novel framework for format creation and adaptation, which is a direct improvement over existing methods. The feedback loop with human experts ensures that the generated formats are of high quality, aligning with Laudan’s focus on methodological improvement. The idea also incorporates **Methodology 7: Designing Critical Experiments** (Duhem-Quine thesis) by proposing experiments to validate the framework's effectiveness across multiple domains and downstream tasks.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that while the target paper highlights the importance of format-following in LLMs, it does not provide a solution for generating or adapting formats. FormatGen fills this gap by offering a generative framework that can autonomously create and refine formats, making it easier for LLMs to follow complex, domain-specific instructions. This has significant implications for real-world applications, such as legal document drafting, medical record keeping, and financial reporting, where precise format adherence is critical. By improving format-following, FormatGen also enhances the performance of downstream tasks, making it a valuable contribution to the field of LLM research."
