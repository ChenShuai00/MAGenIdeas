    "title": "F0 Patterns of L2 English Speech by Mandarin Chinese Learners",
    "abstract": "Prosodic speech characteristics are important in the evaluation of both intelligibility and naturalness of oral pro\ufb01ciency for learners of English as a Second Language (ESL). Different f 0 movement patterns between native and Mandarin Chinese learners have been an important research topic for second-language (L2) English speech learning. However, previous studies have seldom examined f 0 movement patterns between lower-level and higher-level Mandarin ESL learners. The current study compared f 0 change patterns extracted from the same 20 English sentences read by 20 lower- and 20 higher- level Mandarin ESL learners, and 20 native English speakers from a speech database. Appropriate procedures were applied to ensure a more accurate estimation of f 0 values and to catch characteristic deviation in f 0 movement patterns of ESL learners. The results showed that lower-level Mandarin speakers displayed more frequent f 0 \ufb02uctuations and smaller standard deviation of intervals between f 0 peaks than both native speakers and higher-level learners. The special characteristic of many smaller \u201cripples\u201d on pitch contours of lower-level L2 English speech resembles Mandarin Chinese f 0 movements, which suggests a negative transfer from the \ufb01rst language (L1) Mandarin. The \ufb01ndings can shed light on the assessment and learning of L2 English prosody by Mandarin ESL learners."
