    "title": "Rhythm-controllable Attention with High Robustness for Long Sentence Speech Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Regressive Text-to-Speech (TTS) system utilizes attention mechanism to generate alignment between text and acoustic feature sequence. Alignment determines synthesis robustness (e.g, the occurence of skipping, repeating, and collapse) and rhythm via duration control. However, current attention algorithms used in speech synthesis cannot control rhythm using external duration information to generate natural speech while ensuring robustness. In this study, we propose Rhythm-controllable Attention (RC-Attention) based on Tracotron2, which improves robustness and naturalness simultaneously. Proposed attention adopts a trainable scalar learned from four kinds of information to achieve rhythm control, which makes rhythm control more robust and natural, even when synthesized sentences are extremely longer than training corpus. We use word errors counting and AB preference test to measure robustness of proposed method and naturalness of synthesized speech, respectively. Results shows that RC-Attention has the lowest word error rate of nearly 0.6%, compared with 11.8% for baseline system. Moreover, nearly 60% subjects prefer to the speech synthesized with RC-Attention to that with Forward Attention, because the former has more natural rhythm."
