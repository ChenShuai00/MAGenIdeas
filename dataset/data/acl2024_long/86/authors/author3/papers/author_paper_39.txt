    "title": "Deep Feature Transfer Learning for Automatic Pronunciation Assessment",
    "abstract": "Automatic pronunciation assessment is commonly developed to evaluate pronunciation quality of second language (L2) learners. Traditional methods for automatic pronunciation assessment normally utilize speech features such as Goodness of pro-nunciation (GOP), which may not provide suf\ufb01cient information for the pronunciation pro\ufb01ciency assessment [1]. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning method for automatic pro-nunciation assessment. We directly utilize the deep features from the acoustic model instead of traditional features such as GOP, and transfer the acoustic knowledge from ASR to a spe-ci\ufb01c scoring module. The scoring module is designed to consider the relationship among different granularities in an utter-ance based on an attention mechanism. Only this module is updated for faster transfer and adaptation of various pronunciation assessment tasks. Experimental results based on the dataset recorded by Chinese English-as-second-language (ESL) learners and the Speechocean762 1 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional GOP-based baselines in Pearson correlation coef\ufb01cient (PCC) and yields parameter-ef\ufb01cient transfer for different pronunciation assessment tasks."
