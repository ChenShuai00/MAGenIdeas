    "title": "MSRA at TAC 2011: Entity Linking",
    "abstract": "The Knowledge Base Population task aims at advancing the state of the art for systems that automatically discover information about named entities and then incorporate this information in a knowledge source. The overall task of populating a knowledge base is decomposed into two related tasks: Entity Linking, where names must be aligned to entities in the KB, and Slot Filling, which involves mining information about entities from text. We participated in the first task. The entity linking task requires either linking entity mentions in the documents to entries in the Knowledge Base (KB) or highlighting these mentions as non-KB (NIL) entries. The task includes particularly difficult cases like ambiguous mentions (e.g George Bush), aliases (e.g Angela Kasner, more known as Angela Merkel) or even examples of both (e.g ABC). In addition, in order to create new KB entries, the task further requires the participating systems to group NIL mentions referring to the same entities together. As has been done in most entity linking systems, our approach consists of two steps: Candidate generation and candidate disambiguation. For candidate generation, we make use of a recall-oriented retrieval model; and for candidate disambiguation, we treat it as a supervised learning problem. As for the details of grouping the NIL mentions, please refer to (Zhang et al., 2011). We jointly participate in KBP 2011 with the I2INUS team. However, in this paper, we only report the results of the MSRA submissions. The joint submission is reported in (Zhang et al., 2011). In our participation, we are interested in answering the following question: Can an retrieval-based method do a good job for candidate generation? If the answer is YES, we can then leverage many research results with the area of information retrieval."
