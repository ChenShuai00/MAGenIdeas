    "abstract": "The global burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a preeminent etiology of cancer\u2010related mortalities sheds light on the imperative necessity for a more profound comprehension of its fundamental biological mechanisms. In this context, the precise function of the 26S proteasome non\u2010ATPase regulatory subunit 11 (PSMD11) in HCC remains equivocal. To address this vital knowledge gap, we interrogated the cancer genome atlas, genotype\u2010tissue expression, International cancer genome consortium, gene expression omnibus, the cancer cell line encyclopedia, and tumor immune single\u2010cell hub databases to evaluate the expression pattern of PSMD11, further confirmed by reverse\u2010transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010qPCR) in LO2, MHCC\u201097H, HepG2, and SMMC7721 cell lines. Additionally, we meticulously assessed the clinical significance and prognostic value of PSMD11, while also exploring its potential molecular mechanisms in HCC. Our findings demonstrated that PSMD11 was highly expressed in HCC tissues, correlating with pathologic stage and histologic grade, thereby conferring a poor prognosis. Mechanistically, PSMD11 appears to exert its tumorigenic effects through the modulation of tumor metabolism\u2010related pathways. Impressively, low PSMD11 expression was associated with increased immune effector cell infiltration, heightened responsiveness to molecular targeted drugs such as dasatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and imatinib, as well as reduced somatic mutation rate. Additionally, we demonstrated that PSMD11 might modulate HCC development through intricate interactions with cuproptosis\u2010related genes ATP7A, DLAT, and PDHA1. Our comprehensive analyses collectively suggest that PSMD11 represents a promising therapeutic target in HCC."
