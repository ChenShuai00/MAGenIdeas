    "title": "Effects of deficiency and surplus dietary threonine on reproductive performance of primiparous pregnant gilts",
    "abstract": "Dietary threonine imbalance is known to impair reproductive performances of gestating sows, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, effects of deficiency and surplus dietary threonine during gestation on reproductive performance, serum metabolites and hormones concentration, and colostral nutrient and immunoglobulin contents of primiparous sows were investigated. Ninety primiparous pregnant gilts were assigned to one of the three dietary treatments with different standardized ileal digestible threonine/lysine ratios at 0.59, 0.72 and 0.85, which represented deficient (DT), adequate (AT) and surplus (ST) dietary threonine concentration respectively. Maternal body weight gain from day 80-110 of gestation was highest (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) for gilts fed AT than for gilts fed DT or ST. On days 30 and 110, serum threonine concentration increases in a dose-dependent manner with the increasing of dietary threonine concentration in (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01), serum urea nitrogen concentration was lower (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01) in gilts fed AT than DT or ST, and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was lowest (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) for gilts fed DT. On day 110, gilts fed AT had lower serum progesterone concentration but higher concentrations of serum prolactin (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) compared to DT and ST. Concentration of colostral immunoglobulin A and G from gilts fed DT was lower (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) compared with gilts fed AT or ST. In conclusion, gilts with the adequate threonine intake were more able to conserve dietary amino acids to support foetal and maternal tissue gain. Deficient or ST threonine intake may induce a delay in changes in progesterone and prolactin concentrations during the prepartum period impeding the transition from pregnancy to lactation."
