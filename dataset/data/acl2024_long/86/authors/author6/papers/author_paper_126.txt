    "abstract": "Introduction As a new minimally invasive surgery, transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) has been proved to be suitable for the treatment of a variety of gynecological benign diseases. However, compared with other minimally invasive surgeries that have been widely used, such as conventional multiport laparoscopy and transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), their advantages and disadvantages and how to choose are still unknown. The purpose of our study is to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the three minimally invasive surgeries in myomectomy and to provide theoretical basis for the wider development of vNOTES surgery. Material and methods This retrospective study included 282 patients at our hospital who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy from May 2021 to March 2022. Based on the surgical approach, patients were classified into multiport, transumbilical LESS, and vNOTES groups. The patients\u2019 demographic characteristics and follow-up data were collected during the perioperative period and at 1 month postoperatively. Results Among the three procedures, vNOTES had the shortest anal exhaust time but also the highest postoperative infection rate. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the operative time increased by 3.5\u2005min for each 1\u2005cm increase in myoma, and intraoperative bleeding increased by approximately 12\u2005ml. The average duration of single pores increased by 25\u2005min compared to that of multiports, and the operative duration increased by 10.48\u2005min for each degree of adhesion. Conclusions For gynecologists who have mastered vNOTES, this procedure has the same efficacy and safety as the two existing minimally invasive surgeries in myomectomy, but it shows obvious advantages in postoperative recovery."
