    "title": "A heterochromatic histone methyltransferase lowers nucleosome occupancy at euchromatic promoters",
    "abstract": "H3K9me3 (histone H3 modified with tri-methylation at lysine 9) is a hallmark of transcriptional silencing and heterochromatin. However, its global effects on the genome, including euchromatin, are less well understood. Here we develop Formaldehyde-Assisted Identification of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) for C. elegans to examine the chromatin configuration of mutants that lack virtually all H3K9me3, while leaving H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 intact. We find that nucleosomes are mildly disrupted, and levels of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 rise in mutant embryos. In addition to these expected changes, the most dramatic change occurs in euchromatin: many regions encompassing transcription start sites (TSSs) gain an average of two nucleosomes in mutants. The affected regions normally lack H3K9me3, revealing a locus non-autonomous role for H3K9me3. Affected TSSs are associated with genes that are active in epithelia and muscles, and implicated in development, locomotion, morphogenesis and transcription. Mutant embryos develop normally under ideal laboratory conditions but die when challenged, with defects in morphogenesis and development. Our findings reveal that H3K9me3 protects transcription start sites within euchromatin from nucleosome deposition. These results may be relevant to mammals, where diseases that disrupt the nuclear lamina and heterochromatin can alter epithelial and muscle gene expression."
