    "title": "Genetic diversity of Chinese domestic goat based on the mitochondrial DNA sequence variation.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic diversity of domestic goat in China. For this purpose, we determined the sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region in 72 individuals of the Yangtze River delta white goat, and reanalysed 723 published samples from 31 breeds/populations across China. All goat haplotypes were classified into four haplogroups (A-D) previously described. The phylogenetic pattern that emerged from the mtDNA control region sequence was confirmed by the analysis of the entire cytochrome b sequence of eight goats representative of the four haplogroups. It appeared that in Chinese domestic goat, haplogroups A and B were dominant and distributed in nearly all breeds/populations, while haplogroups C and D were only found in seven breeds/populations. Four breeds/populations contained all four haplogroups. When grouping the breeds/populations into five geographic groups based on their geographic distributions and ecological conditions, the southern pasturing area had the highest diversity whereas the northern farming area had the lowest diversity. 84.29% and 11.37% of the genetic variation were distributed within breeds and among breeds within the ecologically geographical areas, respectively; only 4% of genetic variation was observed among the five geographic areas. We speculate that the traditional seasonal pastoralism, the annual long-distance migrations that occurred in the past, and the commercial trade would account for the observed pattern by having favoured gene flows."
