    "title": "Spectacle Design Preferences among Chinese Primary and Secondary Students and Their Parents: A Qualitative and Quantitative Study",
    "abstract": "Purpose To identify the specific characteristics making glasses designs, particularly those compatible with adjustable glasses, more or less appealing to Chinese children and their parents. Patients and Methods Primary and secondary school children from urban and rural China with <\u200a=\u200a\u22121.00 diopters of bilateral myopia and their parents ranked four conventional-style frames identified by local optical shops as popular versus four child-specific frames compatible with adjustable spectacles. Scores based on the proportion of maximum possible ranking were computed for each style. Selected children and their parents also participated in Focus Groups (FGs) discussing spectacle design preference. Recordings were transcribed and coded by two independents reviewers using NVivo software. Results Among 136 urban primary school children (age range 9\u201311 years), 290 rural secondary school children (11\u201317 years) and 16 parents, all adjustable-style frames (scores on 0\u2013100 scale 25.7\u201362.4) were ranked behind all conventional frames (63.0\u201387.5). For eight FGs including 12 primary children, 26 secondary children and 16 parents, average kappa values for NVivo coding were 0.81 (students) and 0.70 (parents). All groups agreed that the key changes to make adjustable designs more attractive were altering the round lenses to rectangular or oval shapes and adding curved earpieces for more stable wear. The thick frames of the adjustable designs were considered stylish, and children indicated they would wear them if the lens shape were modified. Conclusions Current adjustable lens designs are unattractive to Chinese children and their parents, though this study identified specific modifications which would make them more appealing."
