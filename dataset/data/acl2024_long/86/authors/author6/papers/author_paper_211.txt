    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe expression level and clinical significances of long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are presently unknown in the early-stage cervical cancer (CC). This study was aimed to explore the expression signatures of lncRNAs between normal and cervix carcinoma tissues and the prognostic value of LncRNAs in early-stage CC patients.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe patients diagnosed with FIGO stage I-IIb CC of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between January 1st 2006 and December 31st 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Molecular microarray was conducted to identify differentially expression profiles of LncRNAs. In situ hybridization was applied for detection of candidate lncRNAs in cervical tissues.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 2574 upregulated lncRNAs and 3270 downregulated lncRNAs with significantly differential expression (\u22652.0-fold) were identified. Among the differentially expressed lncRNAs, RP11-396F22.1 expression was one of the most significantly overexpressed in the CC tissues compared to nomal cervical tissues (P<0.001). In situ hybridization confirmed RP11-396F22.1 expression was highly expressed in cancerous tissues. The results of Scratch and Transwell test showed that the migration ability decreased remarkably in transfected group (P<0.001). Moreover, the coding gene cpne8 was significantly upregulated by RP11-396F22.1 knockdown (P=0.035).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings demonstrate that LncRNA RP11-396F22.1 might be a potent biomarker for CC progression."
