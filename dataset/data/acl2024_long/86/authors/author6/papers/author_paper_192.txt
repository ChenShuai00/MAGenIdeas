    "abstract": "\n Background\n\nThere existed evidence that the prevalence and glycemic control rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have seasonal variation. The present study aimed to examine the associations between ambient temperature exposure and FPG among different groups (total, non-T2DM, old T2DM and new T2DM groups) and calculate temperature adjusted prevalence and glycemic control rate of T2DM.\n\nMethods\n\nFour cross-sectional health surveys with 26,350 respondents were conducted in Guangdong Province from 2007 to 2015. Multistage cluster sampling was used to recruit study participants. Generalized additive model was employed to evaluate the associations between daily mean temperature and FPG among different groups. The prevalence and glycemic control rate of T2DM were calculated based on the exposure-response association between temperature and FPG.\n\nResults\n\nThe exposure-response curves of temperature and FPG were downward parabola in total, non-T2DM and old-T2DM groups, while it was \u201cU\u201d-shaped without statistically significant for new T2DM cases. When temperature decreased from 30\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C, the FPG significantly increased 0.59 (95%CI: 0.49, 0.68) mmol/L, 0.47 (95%CI: 0.43, 0.52) mmol/L and 1.59 (95%CI: 0.59, 2.59) mmol/L in total, non-T2DM and old-T2DM groups, respectively. When the ambient temperature increased from 5\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, the prevalence of T2DM slowly decreased from 10.03% to 9.39%, and the glycemic control rate of T2DM greatly increased from 31.9% to 58.5%.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe prevalence and glycemic control rate of T2DM are associated with ambient temperature, which suggests temperature should be considered and adjusted when estimating T2DM prevalence and developing clinical management of T2DM."
