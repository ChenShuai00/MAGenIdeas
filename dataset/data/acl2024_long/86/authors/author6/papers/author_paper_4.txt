    "abstract": "Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 has become a major global public health concern in December 2019. However, finding and excluding close contacts of COVID-19 infectors is a critical but difficult issue. This study aimed to introduce a new method of epidemiological investigation named space\u2013time companions, which was adopted in Chengdu, China, in November 2021. Methods An observational investigation was conducted during a small outbreak of COVID-19 in Chengdu, China in November 2021. A new method of epidemiological investigation called space\u2013time companion was adopted in this outbreak, which was defined as the one who stayed in the same spatiotemporal grid (range: 800\u2009m * 800\u2009m) with the confirmed COVID-19 infector for more than 10\u2009min in the last 14\u2009days. A flow chart was used to describe the screening process of space\u2013time companions in detail and illustrate the space\u2013time companion epidemic management method. Results The COVID-19 epidemic outbreak in Chengdu was effectively controlled for approximately one incubation period (14\u2009days). After four rounds of space\u2013time companions screening, more than 450,000 space\u2013time companions were screened, including 27 COVID-19 infectors. Moreover, in the subsequent rounds of nucleic acid testing for all people in the city, no infected person were found proving the end of this epidemic outbreak. Conclusion The space\u2013time companion provides a new idea for screening close contacts of the COVID-19 infector and other similar infectious diseases, which can serve as a supplement to traditional epidemiological history surveys to verify and avoid missing close contacts.
