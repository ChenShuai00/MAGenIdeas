    "title": "A Study on the Flocculation and Sedimentation of Iron Tailings Slurry Based on the Regulating Behavior of Fe3+",
    "abstract": "Based on the regulating behavior of Fe3+, flocculation and sedimentation tests of iron tailings slurry flocculated using 2 mg/L anionic polyacrylamide (APAM) were studied, including the tests of Fe3+ dosage, regulating time, and pH. Flocculation\u2013sedimentation tests showed that: a recommended addition of 56 mg/L Fe3+ produced a surprisingly bad flocculation effect; sedimentation ability decreased with the increase of regulating time, however, the regulating ability during the first 1 min was low; Fe3+ displayed a high regulating effect at pH 6\u20137, and then decreased with the increase of slurry pH. Size analysis demonstrated that the regulating ability of Fe3+ was related to the change of floc size, which increased with the decrease of size. Zeta potential analysis and calculation showed that small concentrations of Fe3+ and certain hydroxyl complex ions (such as Fe(OH)2+ and Fe(OH)2+) adsorbed onto the APAM molecular chains, resulting in a decreased charge density of the APAM molecules, and this electrostatic adsorption was able to make the polymer curl more easily. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopic (FTIR) indicated the APAM on the hematite was slightly degraded into a monomer-like short-chain polymer while adding certain concentration of Fe3+. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) imaging showed that the network structure of APAM molecules treated by Fe3+ collapsed, and the APAM adsorption amount on hematite was significantly reduced. Therefore, the effect of Fe3+ on the APAM could be recommended as a new method for desorption and degradation of the APAM contained in the tailings slurry or flocs."
