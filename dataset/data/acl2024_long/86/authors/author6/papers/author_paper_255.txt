    "title": "Measuring energy meter of three-phase electricity-stealing defense system",
    "abstract": "Electricity-stealing defense is one of the chief steps in distribution network reconstruction. The electronic energy meter is an important invention for measurement energy power system, which is an effective measures for the electricity-stealing defense. And one-time seal technology makes stealing ways reduced to the limited several specific ways that are undercurrent tecnology, undervoltage teconology and phase-shifted teconology. All these ways are stealing electricity in front of the energy meter. Due to these methods of electricity-stealing and actual demand of defending stealing electricity, based on a digital three-phase electric energy meter, The equipment of electricity-stealing defense electronic energy meter is designed, which adopts Atmega 128 as the control core, uses a low power consumption and a high accuracy ADE7758 as the energy metering unit, takes use of the output impulse of standard electricy measure module and user electric energy meter to calculate and judge electricity-stealing by comparing the reading RMS voltage and current from the ADE7758 with the ZigBee wireless acquisition module. Energy meter can communicates with the concentrator by 485, infraned or carrier module. The energy meter sends the effective data back to the concentrator. It is showed that this system can not only accurate measurement of electrical energy, but also to accurately determine the occurrence and electricity-stealing and the time of stealing is also recorded, which bring great convenience to the power system."
