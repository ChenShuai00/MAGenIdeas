    "title": "Enzymatic saccharification promotion for bioenergy poplar under green liquor pretreatment by fully sulfonated polystyrene: Effect of molecular weight.",
    "abstract": "Water-soluble lignin and lignin derivatives are cited to promote the enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulose. Herein, a series of fully sulfonated polystyrene sulfonates (FSPSSs) with various molecular weights (MW) were synthesized through free radical polymerization (FRP) and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) to serve as lignin analogues to boost the enzymatic saccharification of bioenergy poplar under green liquor pretreatment. The FRP-made polymers with MW 944.5\u00d7103 to 123.6\u00d7103 g/mol increased the enzymatic hydrolysis digestibility (SED) by 13% to 18.8%. On contrary, the ATRP-made polymers with lower MW (3.8\u00d7103 \u223c 12.2\u00d7103 g/mol) showed a weak effect with less than 8% improvement in SED. This can be explained the adsorption capacity and the conformation of cellulase-FSPSS complexes, which respond to the reducing nonproductive adsorption correlated to their MWs, due to the strong dependence of molecular conformation on the chain length of strong polyelectrolytes."
