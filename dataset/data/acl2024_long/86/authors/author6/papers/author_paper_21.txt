    "title": "Interdiffusion in Zr-Mo/W Intermetallics",
    "abstract": "Intermetallic compounds or solid solutions can form between Zr and Mo/W, in which the multiphase of the diffusion may be influenced by each other. Interdiffusion kinetic data in such intermetallic systems are highly demanded for material design. In this work, solid\u2013solid diffusion couples of Zr-Mo and Zr-W were prepared by the fixture method, and the interdiffusion behaviors of Zr-Mo and Zr-W at 1300\u20131500 \u00b0C were systematically investigated. The results showed that the intermetallic compounds Mo2Zr/W2Zr formed in the Zr-Mo/W diffusion systems. The growth constants of the Mo2Zr and W2Zr phases varied with temperature in accordance with the Arrhenius relationship, and the activation energies of growth were 109 kJ/mol and 285 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition, (Zr, Mo) solid solution formed between Mo2Zr and pure Zr as diffusion proceeded, resulting in a lower chemical potential for the formation of Mo2Zr. The den Broeder method was used in calculating the interdiffusion coefficients of the solid solution. The results showed that the interdiffusion coefficient in the (Zr, Mo) solid solution decreased with the increase of Mo concentration. Moreover, the diffusion activation energy of the solid solution was evaluated based on the Arrhenius relationship, and the activation energy was 145\u2013170 kJ/mol when the Mo content was in the range of 2\u201310 at. %. These diffusion kinetic data provide a reference for the composition design and preparation technic of Zr-based alloys."
