    "title": "Pan-cancer analysis of the prevalence and associated factors of lung metastasis and the construction of the lung metastatic classification system",
    "abstract": "This study first presents an analysis of the prevalence and associated factors of the lung metastasis (LM) database and then uses this analysis to construct an LM classification system. Using cancer patient data gathered from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database, this study shows that the prevalence of LM is not consistent among different cancers; that is, the prevalence of LM ranges from 0.0013 [brain; 95% confidence interval (95% CI); 0.0010\u20130.0018] to 0.234 (\u201cother digestive organs\u201d; 95% CI; 0.221\u20130.249). This study finds that advanced age, poor grade, higher tumor or node stage, and metastases including bone, brain, and liver are positively related to LM occurrence, while female gender, income, marital status, and insured status are negatively related. Then, this study generates four categories from 58 cancer types based on prevalence and influence factors and satisfactorily validates these. This classification system reflects the LM risk of different cancers. It can guide individualized treatment and the management of these synchronous metastatic cancer patients and help clinicians better distribute medical resources."
