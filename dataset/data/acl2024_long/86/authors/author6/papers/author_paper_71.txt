    "abstract": "The trihelix gene family plays an important role in plant growth and abiotic stress responses. Through the analysis of genomic and transcriptome data, 35 trihelix family members were identified for the first time in Platycodon grandiflorus; they were classified into five subfamilies: GT-1, GT-2, SH4, GT\u03b3, and SIP1. The gene structure, conserved motifs and evolutionary relationships were analyzed. Prediction of physicochemical properties of the 35 trihelix proteins founded, the number of amino acid molecules is between 93 and 960, theoretical isoelectric point is between 4.24 and 9.94, molecular weight is between 9829.77 and 107435.38, 4 proteins among them were stable, and all GRAVY is negative. The full-length cDNA sequence of the PgGT1 gene of the GT-1 subfamily was cloned by PCR. It is a 1165 bp ORF encoding a 387 amino acid protein, with a molecular weight of 43.54 kDa. The predicted subcellular localization of the protein in the nucleus was experimentally verified. After being treated with NaCl, PEG6000, MeJA, ABA, IAA, SA, and ethephon, the expression of PgGT1 gene showed an up-regulated trend except for the roots treated with NaCl and ABA. This study laid a bioinformatics foundation for the research of trihelix gene family and the cultivation of excellent germplasm of P. grandiflorus."
