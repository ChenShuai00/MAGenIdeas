    "abstract": "Purpose Altered DNA methylation, genetic alterations, and environmental factors are involved in tumorigenesis. As a tumor suppressor gene, abnormal EPHA5 methylation was found in gastric cancer (GC) tissues and was linked to the initiation, progression and prognosis of GC. In this study, the EPHA5 methylation level in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) was detected to explore its relationship with GC risk and prognosis. Methods A total of 366 GC cases and 374 controls were selected as the subjects of this study to collect their environmental factors, and the EPHA5 methylation status was detected through the methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting method. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to evaluate the associations among EPHA5 methylation, environmental factors and GC risk. Meanwhile, the propensity score (PS) was used to adjust the imbalance of some independent variables. Results After PS adjustment, EPHA5 Pm (positive methylation) was more likely to increase the GC risk than EPHA5 Nm (negative methylation) (ORb = 1.827, 95% CI [1.202\u20132.777], P = 0.005). EPHA5 Pm had a more significant association with GC risk in the elderly (ORa = 2.785, 95% CI [1.563\u20134.961], P = 0.001) and H. pylori-negative groups (ORa = 2.758, 95% CI [1.369\u20135.555], P = 0.005). Moreover, the combined effects of EPHA5 Pm and H. pylori infection (ORca = 3.543, 95% CI [2.233\u20135.621], P < 0.001), consumption of alcohol (ORca = 2.893, 95% CI [1.844\u20134.539], P < 0.001), and salty food intake (ORca = 4.018, 95% CI [2.538\u20136.362], P < 0.001) on increasing the GC risk were observed. In addition, no convincing association was found between EPHA5 Pm and the GC prognosis. Conclusions EPHA5 methylation in PBLs and its combined effects with environmental risk factors are related to the GC risk."
