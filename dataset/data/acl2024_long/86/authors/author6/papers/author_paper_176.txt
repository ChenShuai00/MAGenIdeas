    "title": "Partial discharge statistical characteristics of oil-paper insulation under high frequency stress",
    "abstract": "High-frequency (HF) oil-immersed transformers with small size and light weight, have been paid widely attention by researchers at home and abroad. The oil-paper insulation of HF transformers frequently withstands high-frequency overvoltages at frequencies of several kHz and above caused by the development of power electronic devices towards high frequency and high power, resulting in the too early failure of oil-paper insulation due to partial discharge (PD). In this study, we try to analyse PD characteristics of oil-paper insulation with HF voltages using the pulse current method. The experimental results show that the dissimilarities in PD characteristics between HF voltages and AC voltages are very evident. PD inception voltage is basically no change with the increase of frequency under HF voltages. The max PD charge of HF voltages is two times higher than that of AC voltages. PD repetition rate is two times higher than that of AC voltages. In addition, it is also observed that a frequency-induced inflection point is existed near 10 kHz. These results might contribute to the higher dv/dt, the effective duration of PD in single cycle and the number of cycles caused by the change of frequency."
