    "title": "Bending Modulated Ultralarge Magnetoresistance in Flexible La0.67Ba0.33MnO3 Thin Film Based Device.",
    "abstract": "Magnetoresistance based information devices have attracted much attention due to the ability to utilize spins as information carriers. To promote the magnetoresistance-based devices, ultrahigh magnetoresistance ratios are highly desirable for magnetic sensing, memory, and artificial intelligent devices, etc. However, today the magnetoresistance devices are facing the challenge of limited magnetoresistance ratio, low work temperature, or high magnetic field, which calls for proper theories and mechanisms. To address it, we first introduce the flexible bending-controlled magnetoresistance device based on the La0.67Ba0.33MnO3 film. Due to the anisotropic resistance of the La0.67Ba0.33MnO3 film and the nonlinear amplification effect of the Zener diode, the device has exhibited strong magnetoresistive performance (\u223c8725% at 1 T, 300 K). Combining the assist from mechanical bending and diode, high magnetic field sensitivity with large magnetoresistance ratio (\u223c1.7 \u00d7 104% at 1 T, 300 K) and low work current (\u223c0.15 mA) is simultaneously achieved at room temperature, which is over 104 times larger than that of the planar La0.67Ba0.33MnO3 film. Based on the above results, we propose one but not the only possible application as tunable multistage switch. Our findings may pave a strategy to develop flexible diode-enhanced magnetoresistance device with ultrahigh magnetoresistance ratios and bending tunable performances."
