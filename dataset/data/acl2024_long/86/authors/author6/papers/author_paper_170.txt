    "abstract": "\n Objective: To assess the relationship between serum albumia and length of stay (LOS) of the intensive care units (ICUs).Design and Participants: we retrospectively analyze 2843 patients from the medical information mart for intensive care III (the MIMIC-III ) database. Materials and Methods: The exposure variable of the present study was serum albumia, which was defined as serum albumia level at the time of admission to ICUs. The outcome variable was LOS of ICUs. The final models were established by multivariate linear regression, and trend test and smooth fitting curves were used to evaluate the association between serum albumia level and LOS of ICUs. The subgroups were conducted based on age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Results: Higher serum albumia level can reduce LOS of ICUs in patients with heart failure (HF) than lower serum albumia level (\u03b2: -1.18; 95%CI: -1.50, -0.86; P <0.001). Trend test and smooth curve fittings suggested that LOS of ICUs was gradually shorten when serum albumia level was gradually increased. The subgroups based on age, sex and BMI demonstrated similar results between serum albumia level and LOS of ICUs.Conclusion: The negative correlation between serum albumia level and LOS of ICUs among patients with HF was found. High serum albumia level might reduce LOS of ICUs in patients with HF, and the conclusion might guide clinical treatments and judge prognosis."
