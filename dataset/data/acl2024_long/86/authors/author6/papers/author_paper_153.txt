    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough numerous studies have suggested that elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is positively correlated with cardiovascular events, especially the heart failure and heart failure-related death (HFRD), evidence of the association between NT-proBNP and the adverse outcomes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is still relatively limited. The present study was performed to evaluate the relationship between NT-proBNP and outcomes in patients with HCM.\u00a0Methods: Observational cohort methodology was used in this study, and a total of 227 patients were included. And the patients were followed for 44.97 \u00b1 16.37 months. Patients were categorized into three groups according to these NT-proBNP tertiles: first tertile (\u2264 910 pg/mL, n=68), second tertile (913-2141 pg/mL, n=68), and third tertile (\u2265 2151 pg/mL, n=69). The adverse outcomes of this study were all-cause death (ACD) and cardiac death (CD).\u00a0Results: According to the risk category of NT-proBNP, the incidences of ACD (P=0.005) and CD (P=0.032) among the three groups showed significant differences. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the ACD and CD in the third tertile have 7.022 folds (hazard risk [HR] =7.022 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.397-35.282], P=0.018) and 7.129 folds ([HR] =7.129 [95% [CI]: 1.329-38.237], P=0.022) increased risks as compared with those in the first tertile. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that the cumulative risks of ACD and CD in patients with HCM tended to increase.\u00a0Conclusion: The present study indicated NT-proBNP was a novel biomarker suitable for predicting adverse prognosis in patients with HCM, which may be used for early recognition and risk stratification."
