    "title": "Structural Color Spectral Response of Dense Structures of Discoidal Particles Generated by Evaporative Assembly.",
    "abstract": "Structural color\u2500optical response due to light diffraction or scattering from submicrometer-scale structures\u2500is a promising means for sustainable coloration. To expand the functionality of structural color, we introduce discoidal shape anisotropy into colloidal particles and characterize how structural color reflection can be engineered. Uniaxial compression of spheres is used to prepare discoids with varying shape anisotropy and particle size. Discoids are assembled into thin films by evaporation. We find that structural color of assembled films displays components due to diffuse backscattering and multilayer reflection. As discoids become more anisotropic, the assembled structure is more disordered. The multilayer reflection is suppressed\u2500peak height becomes smaller and peak width broader; thus, the color is predominantly from diffuse backscattering. Finally, the discoid structural color can be tuned by varying particle size and has low dependence on viewing angle. We corroborate our results by comparing experimental microstructures and measured reflection spectra with Monte Carlo simulations and calculated spectra by finite-difference time-domain simulation. Our findings demonstrate that the two tunable geometries of discoids\u2500size and aspect ratio\u2500generate different effects on spectral response and therefore can function as independent design parameters that expand possibilities for producing noniridescent structural color."
