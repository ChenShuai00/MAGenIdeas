    "title": "The Association between Dietary Vitamin C Intake and the Risk of Esophageal Cancer: An Updated Dose\u2013Response Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Although some epidemiological studies have reported the associations between vitamin C and risk of esophageal cancer, these results are inconsistent. Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis to explore the associations between dietary vitamin C intake and risk of esophageal cancer. We used PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science to screen all published articles, which yielded 18 papers eligible for data extraction (involving 4,126 cases and 36,902 controls), and then pooled the odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects model. As we detected the associations in highest category and the lowest type of dietary vitamin C intake, we discovered that dietary vitamin C intake was negatively correlated to the risk of esophageal cancer. The analysis of subgroup showed a significant counter proportion between vitamin C and the risk of ESCC and EAC. Moreover, the dose-analysis indicated that if increasing dietary intake of vitamin C of 50\u2009mg/day, esophageal cancer risk dropped down 10% (OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.75-0.87). In summary, our study provides a comprehensive and updated epidemiological evidence to elucidate the relationships between dietary vitamin C and reduction of esophageal cancer risk. Nevertheless, we still need larger case-control and cohort studies to confirm these connections."
