    "title": "Evolutionary Multitasking-Based Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm for Channel Selection in Hybrid Brain Computer Interfacing Systems",
    "abstract": "Hybrid-modality brain-computer Interfaces (BCIs), which combine motor imagery (MI) bio-signals and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), has attracted wide attention in the research field of neural engineering. The number of channels should be as small as possible for real-life applications. However, most of recent works about channel selection only focus on either the performance of classification task or the effectiveness of device control. Few works conduct channel selection for MI and SSVEP classification tasks simultaneously. In this paper, a multitasking-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (EMMOA) was proposed to select appropriate channels for these two classification tasks at the same time. Moreover, a two-stage framework was introduced to balance the number of selected channels and the classification accuracy in the proposed algorithm. The experimental results verified the feasibility of multiobjective optimization methodology for channel selection of hybrid BCI tasks."
