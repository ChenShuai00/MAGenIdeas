    "abstract": "Abstract Camptothecin-20(s)-O-glycine ester-[N-(3\u2032\u03b1, 12\u2032\u03b1-dihydroxy-24\u2032-carbonyl-5\u2032\u03b2-cholan)] (A2), 10-(3\u2032\u03b1,12\u2032\u03b1-dihydroxy-5\u2032\u03b2-cholan-24\u2032-carboxyl)-(20\u2009s)-camptothecin (C2), and 10-O-(3-O-(3\u2032\u03b1, 12\u2032\u03b1-dihydroxy-24\u2032-carbonyl-5\u2032\u03b2-cholan)-propyl)-(20S)-camptothecin (D2) are novel camptothecin-deoxycholic acid analogues. MTT assays were performed to assess the anticancer activity of these compounds against hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721, breast carcinoma MCF-7, and colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 cells. A2 had a high killing ability on SMMC-7721 cells selectively, but C2 and D2 did not exhibit selectivity with regard to SMMC-7721 killing. Uptake assays were performed in an effort to elucidate the transport mechanisms of A2 into SMMC-7721 cells. A2 increased the mRNA expression of OATP1B3 (an organic anion-transporting polypeptide) and uptake of A2 was inhibited by rifampin (inhibitor of OATP1B3), which indicated that the transporter-mediated transport of A2 was mediated by OATP1B3. In addition, according to the western blot and apoptosis assays, we found that A2 killed SMMC-7721 cells by inducing cell apoptosis mainly via an AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) pathway and a caspase-dependent mitochondria apoptosis pathway."
