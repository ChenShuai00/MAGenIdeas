They hoped to vertically align Ti3C2Tx in the specific liquid-crystal phase. However, this was not a trivial task, according to Yu Xia, first author of the article: \u201cThe biggest challenge is that very little is known in the field of two-dimensional materials-based liquid crystals.... Everything had to start from scratch.\u201d A solution came soon. The researchers attached a surfactant, hexaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E6), onto the surface of Ti3C2Tx through hydrogen bonds, which turned the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets into high-order liquid crystals, coined lamellar nematics. Upon applying a shear force, these surface-modified Ti3C2Tx sheets \u201cstand\u201d straight on the substrate, forming orderly distributed arrays, as suggested by liquid-crystal theory. These vertical arrays were maintained after the C12E6 surfactants were removed. This structure contains abundant inter-sheet slits that serve as ion-movement \u201cexpressways\u201d to allow quick ion diffusion. Electrochemical testing revealed that the vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx nanosheets are capable of being charged rapidly. Cyclic voltammetry tests showed that the 200-\u03bcmthick film electrode lost little of its chargestorage capacity at a fast charging rate of 1000 mV s\u20131. This behavior was observed in electrodes that were 40\u2013320 \u03bcm thick. The control sample, the same Ti3C2Tx nanosheets but stacked parallel to the substrate, abruptly lost its charge-storage capability starting at an intermediate rate of 10 mV s\u20131, even though the thickness was only 35 \u03bcm. The results unambiguously highlight the advantage of the vertical arrangement in retaining the fast chargestorage characteristic of MXene-based supercapacitor electrodes. \u201cIt is amazing that simply making MXenes \u2018stand up\u2019 leads to such a big difference,\u201d says Yat Li of the University of California, Santa Cruz. \u201cThis work shows an innovative method of controlling the alignment of electrochemically active materials to achieve ultrafast directional ion diffusion in thick electrodes,\u201d he says. Li was not involved in this study. This method may encourage a plethora of future work. Gogotsi says, \u201cAlignment of mechanically strong and electrically conductive MXene layers may lead to manufacturing of MXene fibers, membranes, coatings, and other forms with unique and anisotropic properties for various applications beyond energy storage.\u201d Tianyu Liu"
