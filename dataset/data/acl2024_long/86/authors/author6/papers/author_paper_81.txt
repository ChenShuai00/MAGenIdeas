    "abstract": "We investigate the effects of a nonuniform uniaxial strain and a triaxial strain on the $\\alpha-{\\cal T}_3$ lattice. The analytical expressions of the pseudo-Landau levels (pLLs) are derived based on low-energy Hamiltonians, and are verified by tight-binding calculations. We find the pseudo-magnetic field leads to the oscillating density of states, and the first pLL is sublattice polarized, which is distributed on only two of the three sets of sublattices. For the nonuniform uniaxial strain, we show that pLLs become dispersive due to the renormalization of the Fermi velocity, and a valley polarized current emerges. Our results generalize the study of pseudo-magnetic field to the $\\alpha-{\\cal T}_3$ lattice, which will not only deepen the understanding of the intriguing effects of mechanical strains, but also provide theoretical foundation for possible experimental studies of the effects of strain on the $\\alpha-{\\cal T}_3$ lattice."
