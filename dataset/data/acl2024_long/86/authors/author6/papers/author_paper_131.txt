    "title": "A Novel Multiplicative Fault Observer for actuators of Satellite Attitude Control System",
    "abstract": "The actuator is an important part of the satellite attitude control system, and the damage degradation on it will have a serious impact on the overall control of the system. In previous studies, relevant researchers have made much effort in the additive fault estimation and the corresponding control design. However, the multiplicative fault estimation for the actuator still remains a challenge, especially when the fault is coupled with external disturbances. Therefore, this paper attempts to propose a novel sliding mode fault observer to estimate the multiplicative actuator fault coupled with external disturbances for actuators of the satellite attitude control system. In the designed fault observer, the super-twisting sliding mode algorithm is used to suppress external disturbances, so as to realize the relatively accurate estimation of the fault. A numerical simulation example on the satellite attitude control system is presented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed multiplicative fault observer."
