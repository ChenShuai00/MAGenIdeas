    "title": "Fully distributed event\u2010triggered asymptotic attitude coordination of multiple spacecraft systems with disturbances",
    "abstract": "This article studies the leader\u2010following attitude coordination problem of a group of rigid spacecraft subject to communication constraint, disturbances and uncertain control coefficient matrices. A fully distributed adaptive anti\u2010disturbance attitude coordinated control scheme with event\u2010triggering mechanism is developed. First, the event\u2010triggered adaptive distributed observer is designed for each follower to estimate the leader's information without continuous communication requirement. Based on the estimated information, the adaptive anti\u2010disturbance attitude tracking controller is designed such that asymptotic coordinated tracking can be achieved under additive disturbances and actuators' partial loss of efficiency. The proposed control scheme ensures that all the closed\u2010loop signals are bounded and the positive lower bound of inter\u2010event times exists in each subsystem. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed control scheme."
