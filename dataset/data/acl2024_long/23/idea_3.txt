    "Title": "Explainable Argument Generation: A Framework for Generating Transparent and Interpretable Arguments",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework for generating explainable arguments, where the reasoning process behind each argument is made transparent and interpretable. The framework uses an LLM to generate arguments, but also produces a detailed explanation of the reasoning steps involved, including the premises, assumptions, and logical connections. The framework will be evaluated on a benchmark dataset of argumentative texts, with human annotators assessing the quality and interpretability of the generated arguments and explanations. The proposed framework has the potential to significantly improve the transparency and interpretability of argument generation systems, making them more trustworthy and useful in real-world applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**, which emphasizes the importance of abstracting general laws from multiple related studies. By synthesizing existing research on explainable AI and argument generation, this framework aims to create a unified approach that combines the strengths of both fields. Additionally, **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is used to propose a novel hypothesis: that generating transparent and interpretable arguments can improve the trustworthiness and usability of argument generation systems. The framework leverages the strengths of LLMs for natural language generation while incorporating techniques from explainable AI to make the reasoning process transparent.",
    "Rationale": "Current argument generation systems often produce arguments that are difficult to interpret or verify, limiting their usefulness in real-world applications. This framework addresses this limitation by generating arguments that are accompanied by detailed explanations of the reasoning process. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of computational argumentation by improving the transparency and interpretability of argument generation systems, which is essential for their adoption in critical applications such as law, public policy, and healthcare."
