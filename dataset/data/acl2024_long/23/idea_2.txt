    "Title": "Argument Mining in Low-Resource Languages: Leveraging LLMs for Cross-Lingual Transfer",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of LLMs for argument mining in low-resource languages, where annotated datasets are scarce or nonexistent. The approach involves fine-tuning a multilingual LLM on a high-resource language (e.g., English) and then transferring the learned model to a low-resource language using cross-lingual transfer techniques. The system will be evaluated on a newly created dataset of arguments in low-resource languages, with performance compared to existing methods. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve argument mining in low-resource languages, enabling the development of argumentation systems for a wider range of languages and cultures.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the importance of exploring theoretical boundaries and integrating interdisciplinary knowledge. By applying LLMs to argument mining in low-resource languages, this approach pushes the boundaries of current research, which has primarily focused on high-resource languages. Additionally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is used to design and improve the cross-lingual transfer techniques, ensuring that the approach is robust and effective. The use of LLMs enables the system to leverage pre-trained knowledge, making it more scalable and applicable to a wide range of languages.",
    "Rationale": "Argument mining in low-resource languages is a challenging task due to the lack of annotated datasets and linguistic resources. This approach addresses this challenge by leveraging the strengths of LLMs, which can be fine-tuned on high-resource languages and then transferred to low-resource languages. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of computational argumentation by enabling the development of argumentation systems for a wider range of languages and cultures, which is essential for promoting global dialogue and understanding."
