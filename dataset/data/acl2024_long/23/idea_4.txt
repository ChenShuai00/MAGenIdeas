    "Title": "Dynamic Argument Adaptation: A Framework for Real-Time Argument Generation in Evolving Contexts",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework for dynamic argument adaptation, where arguments are generated and adapted in real-time based on evolving contexts and new information. The framework uses an LLM to generate initial arguments, but also incorporates a feedback loop that allows the system to update and refine arguments as new information becomes available. The framework will be evaluated in a simulated environment where the context evolves over time, with performance compared to static argument generation methods. The proposed framework has the potential to significantly improve the adaptability and relevance of argument generation systems, making them more effective in dynamic and uncertain environments.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings**, which emphasizes the importance of explaining and integrating anomalies. By incorporating a feedback loop, this framework addresses a key limitation in current argument generation methods, which often fail to adapt to new information or changing contexts. Additionally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is used to design and improve the feedback loop, ensuring that the system can effectively update and refine arguments in real-time. The use of LLMs enables the system to generate natural language arguments that are coherent and contextually relevant.",
    "Rationale": "Current argument generation systems often produce static arguments that do not adapt to new information or changing contexts, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. This framework addresses this limitation by incorporating a feedback loop that allows the system to update and refine arguments in real-time. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of computational argumentation by improving the adaptability and relevance of argument generation systems, which is essential for their use in real-world applications such as debate systems, negotiation support, and decision-making tools."
