    "title": "Is ChatGPT A Good Translator? A Preliminary Study",
    "abstract": "This report provides a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT for machine translation, including translation prompt, multilingual translation, and translation robustness. We adopt the prompts advised by ChatGPT to trigger its translation ability and \ufb01nd that the candidate prompts generally work well and show minor performance differences. By evaluating on a number of benchmark test sets 1 , we \ufb01nd that ChatGPT performs competitively with commercial translation products (e.g., Google Translate) on high-resource European languages but lags behind signi\ufb01cantly on low-resource or distant languages. For distant languages, we explore an interesting strategy named pivot prompting that asks ChatGPT to translate the source sentence into a high-resource pivot language before into the target language, which improves the translation performance signi\ufb01cantly. As for the translation robustness, ChatGPT does not perform as well as the commercial systems on biomedical abstracts or Reddit comments but is potentially a good translator for spoken language."
