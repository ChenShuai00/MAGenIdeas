    "abstract": "In recent years, social media has revolutio n-ized how people communicate and share i n-formation. On e function of social media, b e-sides connecting with friends, is sharing opi n-ions with others. Micro blogging sites , like Twitter , ha ve often provided an online forum for social activism. When users debat e about controversial topics on social media , they ty p-ically share different types of evidence to support their claim s . C lassif ying these types of evidence can provide an estimate for how adequately the arguments have been suppor t-ed. We first introduce a manually built gold standard dataset of 3000 tweets related to the recent FBI and Apple encryption debate. We develop a framework for automatically class i-fying six evidence types typically used o n Twitter to discu ss the debate. Our findings show that a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained with n - gram and additional features is capable of capturing the different forms of represent ing evidence o n Twitter , and exhibit s significant improvements over the unig ram baseline, achieving a F 1 ma cro - averaged of 82.8%."
