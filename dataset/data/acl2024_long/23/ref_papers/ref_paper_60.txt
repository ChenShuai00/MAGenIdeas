    "title": "Context Dependent Claim Detection",
    "abstract": "While discussing a concrete controversial topic, most humans will find it challenging to swiftly raise a diverse set of convincing and relevant claims that should set the basis of their arguments. Here, we formally define the challenging task of automatic claim detection in a given context and discuss its associated unique difficulties. Further, we outline a preliminary solution to this task, and assess its performance over annotated real world data, collected specifically for that purpose over hundreds of Wikipedia articles. We report promising results of a supervised learning approach, which is based on a cascade of classifiers designed to properly handle the skewed data which is inherent to the defined task. These results demonstrate the viability of the introduced task."
