    "Title": "Cross-Domain Argumentation: Leveraging LLMs for Transfer Learning in Computational Argumentation",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of LLMs for cross-domain argumentation, where models trained in one domain (e.g., legal argumentation) are adapted to perform well in another domain (e.g., public policy). The approach involves fine-tuning LLMs on a source domain and then using transfer learning techniques to adapt them to a target domain. The significance of this idea lies in its potential to reduce the need for domain-specific training data, which is often scarce and expensive to obtain. This approach could enable LLMs to perform well in a wide range of argumentation tasks across different domains, making them more versatile and cost-effective. The idea also includes a benchmark dataset for cross-domain argumentation, enabling systematic evaluation and comparison of different transfer learning techniques.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes exploring theoretical boundaries and integrating interdisciplinary knowledge. The hypothesis is that LLMs can be adapted to perform well in cross-domain argumentation tasks by leveraging transfer learning techniques. The idea also draws on **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** to improve existing methods for domain adaptation in argumentation tasks. By addressing the challenge of cross-domain argumentation, this idea opens up new possibilities for applying LLMs in diverse domains. The potential impact of this idea is high, as it reduces the barriers to deploying LLMs in new domains and enhances their practical utility.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the observation that current LLMs are often limited to specific domains due to the lack of domain-specific training data. By leveraging transfer learning techniques, this idea addresses this limitation and enables LLMs to perform well in cross-domain argumentation tasks. The benchmark dataset and evaluation metrics will also enable researchers to compare and improve different transfer learning techniques, driving progress in the field. This idea has the potential to significantly expand the applicability of LLMs in computational argumentation, making it a valuable contribution to the field."
