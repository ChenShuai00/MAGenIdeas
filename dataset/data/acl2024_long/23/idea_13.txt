    "Title": "Cross-Domain Argument Mining: Leveraging LLMs for Generalizable Argument Extraction",
    "Idea": "This research explores the use of LLMs for cross-domain argument mining, where the goal is to extract arguments from texts in domains not seen during training. The approach involves fine-tuning LLMs on a diverse set of argument mining datasets and then evaluating their ability to generalize to new domains. The research also introduces a novel transfer learning technique that leverages domain-invariant features of arguments, enabling LLMs to perform well even in domains with limited labeled data. The framework includes a comprehensive evaluation across multiple domains, including law, healthcare, and public policy, to demonstrate its generalizability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Define New Scientific Problems (Kuhn’s paradigm theory)** and **Construct and Modify Theoretical Models (Kitcher’s unified theory of science)**. The new scientific problem is the challenge of cross-domain argument mining, which has not been extensively studied. The theoretical model involves unifying domain-invariant features of arguments, enabling LLMs to generalize across domains.",
    "Rationale": "Argument mining is a critical task in computational argumentation, but existing systems often struggle to generalize across domains. By developing a cross-domain argument mining framework, we can significantly expand the applicability of LLMs in real-world scenarios, where arguments are often found in diverse and domain-specific contexts. This idea has the potential to open up new research directions in argument mining, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
