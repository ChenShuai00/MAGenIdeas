    "Title": "Argument Quality Assessment via LLMs: A Unified Framework for Logical, Rhetorical, and Dialectical Dimensions",
    "Idea": "This research introduces a unified framework for assessing the quality of arguments generated by LLMs across three dimensions: logical coherence, rhetorical effectiveness, and dialectical robustness. The framework leverages fine-tuned LLMs to evaluate arguments based on these dimensions, providing a comprehensive quality score that can be used to improve argument generation systems. The framework also includes a novel dataset of arguments annotated for logical fallacies, rhetorical strategies, and dialectical strengths, enabling more robust training and evaluation of LLMs in computational argumentation.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Construct and Modify Theoretical Models (Quine’s holism)** and **Explaining and Integrating Anomalous Findings (Kuhn’s theory of crises and revolutions)**. The theoretical model unifies multiple dimensions of argument quality, which are often treated separately in existing research. The integration of anomalous findings refers to addressing the inconsistencies in how argument quality is currently assessed, leading to a more holistic and reliable evaluation framework.",
    "Rationale": "Argument quality is a critical aspect of computational argumentation, but existing methods often focus on a single dimension (e.g., logical coherence). By developing a unified framework that considers multiple dimensions, we can provide a more comprehensive assessment of argument quality, which is essential for improving LLM-based argument generation systems. This idea has the potential to set a new standard for argument quality assessment, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
