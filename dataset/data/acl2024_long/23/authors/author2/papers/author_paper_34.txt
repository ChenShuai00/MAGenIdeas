    "title": "Application of Robust Estimation Method for Establishing 3D Combined Terrestrial and GNSS Network: A case of a Quarry in Lang Son, Vietnam",
    "abstract": "Recently, in Vietnam, the detection of geodetic measurements that contain rough errors as well as such data processing method has been considered as a key step in geodetic data processing, especially for large geodetic networks with many different types of measurements like 3D Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) network. On the other hand, mines in Vietnam often have complex terrains, so it is necessary to apply modern and flexible surveying methods in combination with ground and space measurements to build 3D coordinates control networks for management and exploitation to ensure sustainable development. Therefore, this research developed a Robust estimation method based on empirical weighting function for establishing 3D geodetic network combining terrestrial observation and GNSS vectors. The experiment on processing the combined network in Lang Son limestone quarry, Vietnam showed that the proposed method could be an effective solution for processing 3D terrestrial \u2013 GNSS geodetic network for mine surveying in Vietnam."
