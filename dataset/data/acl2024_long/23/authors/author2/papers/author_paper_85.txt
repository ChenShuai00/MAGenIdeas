    "title": "Automated Verifying Anonymity and Privacy Properties of Security Protocols",
    "abstract": "Security protocols play more and more important role with widely use in many applications nowadays. They are designed to provide security properties for users who wish to exchange messages over unsecured medium. There are many tools were designed to specify and verify security protocols such as Casper/FDR, ProVerif or AVISPA. While most of the existing tools focus on secrecy and authentication properties. few supports properties like anonymity and privacy, which are crucial in many protocols such as in electronic voting systems or anonymous online transactions. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is still not have a fully automatic tool using formal methods to verify these two properties. In this paper, we introduce a framework for specifying security protocols in the Labeled Transition System (LTS) semantics model and give the formal definition for three existing types of anonymity and privacy properties using this model. We also come up with the verification algorithms for verification and implement all the ideas in a module SeVe inside PAT model checker."
