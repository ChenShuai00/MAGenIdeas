    "title": "Difficulty Controllable Question Generation for Reading Comprehension",
    "abstract": "We investigate the difficulty levels of questions, and propose a new setting called Difficulty-controllable Question Generation (DQG). Taking as input a reading comprehension paragraph and some text fragments (i.e. answers) in the paragraph that we want to ask questions about, a DQG method needs to generate questions each of which has a given text fragment as its answer, and meanwhile the generation is under the control of specified difficulty labels---the output questions should satisfy the specified difficulty as much as possible. To solve this task, we propose an end-to-end framework to generate questions of designated difficulty levels. Specifically, we explore a few intuitions: (i) In the input sentences, the nearer a word is to the answer fragment, the more likely it is used in the question; (ii) The easier a question is, the nearer its words are to the answer fragment in the sentence; (iii) Performing difficulty control could be regarded as a problem of sentence generation towards a specified attribute or style, namely difficulty level. For evaluation, we prepared the first dataset of reading comprehension questions with difficulty labels. The results show that our framework not only generates questions of better quality under the metrics like BLEU, but also has the capability to generate questions complying with the specified difficulty labels."
