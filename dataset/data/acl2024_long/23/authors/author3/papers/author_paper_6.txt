    "title": "Is Translation All You Need? A Study on Solving Multilingual Tasks with Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated multilingual capabilities; yet, they are mostly English-centric due to the imbalanced training corpora. Existing works leverage this phenomenon to improve their multilingual performances through translation, primarily on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This work extends the evaluation from NLP tasks to real user queries and from English-centric LLMs to non-English-centric LLMs. While translation into English can help improve the performance of multilingual NLP tasks for English-centric LLMs, it may not be optimal for all scenarios. For culture-related tasks that need deep language understanding, prompting in the native language tends to be more promising as it better captures the nuances of culture and language. Our experiments reveal varied behaviors among different LLMs and tasks in the multilingual context. Therefore, we advocate for more comprehensive multilingual evaluation and more efforts toward developing multilingual LLMs beyond English-centric ones."
