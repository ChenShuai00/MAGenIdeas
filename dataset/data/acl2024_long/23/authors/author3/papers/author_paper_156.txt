    "title": "Using Graphs of Classifiers to Impose Constraints on Semi-supervised Relation Extraction",
    "abstract": "We propose a general approach to modeling semi-supervised learning constraints on unlabeled data. Both traditional supervised classi\ufb01cation tasks and many natural semi-supervised learning heuristics can be approximated by specifying the desired outcome of walks through a graph of classi\ufb01ers. We demonstrate the modeling capability of this approach in the task of relation extraction, and experimental results show that the modeled constraints achieve better performance as expected."
