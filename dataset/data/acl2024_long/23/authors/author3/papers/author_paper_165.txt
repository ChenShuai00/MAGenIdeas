    "title": "Web Query Reformulation via Joint Modeling of Latent Topic Dependency and Term Context",
    "abstract": "An important way to improve users\u2019 satisfaction in Web search is to assist them by issuing more effective queries. One such approach is query reformulation, which generates new queries according to the current query issued by users. A common procedure for conducting reformulation is to generate some candidate queries first, then a scoring method is employed to assess these candidates. Currently, most of the existing methods are context based. They rely heavily on the context relation of terms in the history queries and cannot detect and maintain the semantic consistency of queries. In this article, we propose a graphical model to score queries. The proposed model exploits a latent topic space, which is automatically derived from the query log, to detect semantic dependency of terms in a query and dependency among topics. Meanwhile, the graphical model also captures the term context in the history query by skip-bigram and n-gram language models. In addition, our model can be easily extended to consider users\u2019 history search interests when we conduct query reformulation for different users. In the task of candidate query generation, we investigate a social tagging data resource\u2014Delicious bookmark\u2014to generate addition and substitution patterns that are employed as supplements to the patterns generated from query log data."
