    "Title": "LLM-Driven Argument Quality Assessment: A Multi-Dimensional Framework for Computational Argumentation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel multi-dimensional framework for assessing the quality of arguments generated by LLMs. The framework integrates logical consistency, rhetorical effectiveness, and dialectical robustness as key dimensions of argument quality. By leveraging LLMs' ability to understand and generate natural language, the framework will automatically evaluate arguments across these dimensions using a combination of rule-based metrics, neural network-based classifiers, and human-in-the-loop feedback. The framework will also include a benchmark dataset of high-quality arguments annotated with these dimensions, enabling systematic evaluation and improvement of LLMs in argumentation tasks. The significance of this idea lies in its potential to provide a comprehensive and standardized approach to argument quality assessment, which is currently lacking in computational argumentation research. This could lead to more reliable and interpretable LLM-generated arguments, benefiting applications in law, public policy, and AI-driven decision-making systems.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes identifying anomalies in existing theories. Current methods for evaluating argument quality in computational argumentation are fragmented and lack a unified framework. By defining a new scientific problem—how to systematically assess argument quality—this idea addresses a critical gap in the field. Additionally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is used to design a more robust evaluation framework that integrates multiple dimensions of argument quality, improving upon existing methods that focus on single dimensions (e.g., logical consistency). The potential impact of this idea is high, as it provides a foundation for future research on argument quality and enhances the practical utility of LLMs in argumentation tasks.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea stems from the growing importance of computational argumentation in AI applications and the need for reliable evaluation methods. Current LLMs excel at generating arguments but struggle with ensuring their quality across multiple dimensions. By developing a multi-dimensional framework, this idea addresses a key limitation of existing methods and provides a pathway for improving LLM-generated arguments. The benchmark dataset and evaluation metrics will also enable researchers to compare and improve different models, driving progress in the field."
