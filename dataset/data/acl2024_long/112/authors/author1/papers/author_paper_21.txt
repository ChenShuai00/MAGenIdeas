    "title": "Assessing Data Efficiency in Task-Oriented Semantic Parsing",
    "abstract": "Data efficiency, despite being an attractive characteristic, is often challenging to measure and optimize for in task-oriented semantic parsing; unlike exact match, it can require both model- and domain-specific setups, which have, historically, varied widely across experiments. In our work, as a step towards providing a unified solution to data-efficiency-related questions, we introduce a four-stage protocol which gives an approximate measure of how much in-domain,\"target\"data a parser requires to achieve a certain quality bar. Specifically, our protocol consists of (1) sampling target subsets of different cardinalities, (2) fine-tuning parsers on each subset, (3) obtaining a smooth curve relating target subset (%) vs. exact match (%), and (4) referencing the curve to mine ad-hoc (target subset, exact match) points. We apply our protocol in two real-world case studies -- model generalizability and intent complexity -- illustrating its flexibility and applicability to practitioners in task-oriented semantic parsing."
