    "title": "Spanish Legalese Language Model and Corpora",
    "abstract": "There are many Language Models for the English language according to its worldwide relevance. However, for the Spanish language, even if it is a widely spoken language, there are very few Spanish Language Models which result to be small and too general. Legal slang could be think of a Spanish variant on its own as it is very complicated in vocabulary, semantics and phrase understanding. For this work we gathered legal-domain corpora from different sources, generated a model and evaluated against Spanish general domain tasks. The model provides reasonable results in those tasks."
