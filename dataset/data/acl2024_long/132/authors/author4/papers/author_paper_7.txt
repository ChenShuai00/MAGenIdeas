    "title": "Judging Statistical Criticism",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Bross (1960) proposes rules for statistical criticism, chiefly that critics bear the responsibility of proving the tenability of a counterhypothesis. This Comment makes three points. First, the higher the tenability standard, the more statisticians will be drawn into the local ground rules of a substantive field. Bross feared this prospect, yet his work exemplifies it. Second, more content needs to be given to the tenability standard across domains. Proving tenability may be untenable, for instance, when data is unavailable. Third, Bross\u2019s proposal ultimately led him to espouse a quasi-judicial \u201cadversary science\u201d proceeding to resolve controversial issues of public policy (Bross, 1980). But Bross\u2019s own involvement in a pilot at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission illustrates the difficulties with a \u201cscience court\u201d model, with adversarialism potentially exacerbating rather than muting political conflict. I illustrate these points with the common setting of statistical evidence in an antidiscrimination suit, using data from the University of Texas at Austin School of Law. Ultimately, Bross\u2019s work raises profound questions about the institutions for judging statistical criticism."
