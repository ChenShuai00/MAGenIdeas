    "title": "The Impact of Damage Caps on Malpractice Claims: Randomization Inference with Difference-in-Differences",
    "abstract": "We use differences-in-differences (DID) to assess the impact of damage caps on medical malpractice claims for states adopting caps between 1991\u20132004. We find that conventional DID estimators exhibit acute model sensitivity. As a solution, we offer (nonparametric) covariance-adjusted randomization inference, which incorporates information about cap adoption more directly and reduces model sensitivity. We find no evidence that caps affect the number of malpractice claims against physicians."
