    "abstract": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s court-packing plan of 1937 and the \u201cswitch in time that saved nine\u201d animate central questions of law, politics, and history. Did Supreme Court Justice Roberts abruptly switch votes in 1937 to avert a showdown with Roosevelt? Scholars disagree vigorously about whether Roberts\u2019s transformation was gradual and anticipated or abrupt and unexpected. Using newly collected data of votes from the 1931\u20131940 terms, we contribute to the historical understanding of this episode by providing the fi rst quantitative evidence of Roberts\u2019s transformation. Applying modern measurement methods, we show that Roberts shifted sharply to the left in the 1936 term. The shift appears sudden and temporary. The duration of Roberts\u2019s shift, however, is in many ways irrelevant, as the long-term transformation of the Court is overwhelmingly attributable to Roosevelt\u2019s appointees."
