    "title": "Mandatory Retirement and Age, Race, and Gender Diversity of University Faculties",
    "abstract": "While many have documented the changing demographics of universities, understanding the effects of prohibiting mandatory retirement (\u201cuncapping\u201d) has proved challenging. We digitize detailed directories of all American law school faculty from 1971\u20132017 and show that uncapping in 1994 had dramatic effects. From 1971 to 1993, the percent of faculty above 70\u2014when mandatory retirement would typically have been triggered\u2014remained stable at 1%, but starting in 1994, that proportion increased to 14%. We use a permutation test of moving cohorts to show that these increases are attributable to uncapping. Roughly 39% of faculty members would counterfactually have been subject to mandatory retirement. Effects were less pronounced at public schools, which were more likely to have defined benefits retirement plans. Second, we show that schools with the highest proportion of faculty over 70, and thus most impacted by uncapping, also exhibit the slowest integration of female and minority faculty members. Our study highlights crosscutting effects of civil rights laws: preventing age discrimination can have collateral effects on racial and gender integration."
