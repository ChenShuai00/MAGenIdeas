When it comes to enforcement\u2014including equity considerations\u2014an agency is a \u201cthey,\u201d not an \u201cit.\u201d Second, I demonstrate that recent proposals for food-safety agencies to use big data to target inspections would have considerable distributive implications, shifting public enforcement resources away from minority and immigrant areas and importing the digital divide into regulatory enforcement. Third, information disclosure in the form of restaurant letter grading presents complex equity trade-offs. Conventional letter grading ignores differences in inspection stringency, resulting in dramatic geographic differences solely due to the identity of the inspector. I demonstrate how to design a more accurate and consistent grading system, but I also show that this system can magnify differences across cuisines. These case studies demonstrate both the profound"
