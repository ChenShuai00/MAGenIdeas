    "title": "Does Class Size Reduce the Gender Gap ? A Natural Experiment in Law",
    "abstract": "We study a unique natural experiment in which Stanford Law School randomly assigned first-year students to small or large sections of mandatory courses from 2001-2011. We provide evidence (i) that small sections closed a slight (but substantively and highly statistically significant) gender gap existing in large sections from 2001-08; (ii) that reforms in 2008, which modified the grading system and instituted small, graded, writing and simulation-intensive courses, eliminated the gap entirely; and (iii) that women, if anything, outperformed men in small, simulation-based courses. Our evidence suggests that pedagogical policy --particularly small class sizes --can reduce, and even reverse, achievement gaps in post-graduate education. * Thanks to Kristen Altenburger, Rebecca Morris, and Michael Morse for invaluable research assistance, Ian Ayres, Stuart Benjamin, Beth Colgan, Faye Deal, Stephen Galoob, Paul Goldstein, Gillian Hadfield, Amalia Kessler, Jon Klick, Larry Kramer, Liz Magill, Jenny Martinez, Bernie Meyler, Alison Morantz, Deborah Rhode, George Triantis, Laura Trice, and participants at the Center for Law and Social Sciences Workshop at the University of Southern California School of Law, the Faculty Colloquium at the University of Colorado Boulder School of Law, the faculty workshop at Duke Law School, and the Conference on Empirical Legal Studies at the University of Pennsylvania Law School for helpful comments and conversations, Elizabeth Di Giovanni, Kim Borg, Nicole Cagampan, Kyung Chong, Faye Deal, Carol Ida, Anna O\u2019Neill, Susan Robinson, Mila Fernandez-Ronquillo for help in collecting law school data, and the many faculty members responding to our inquiries about pedagogy. \u2020 Professor of Law, Stanford Law School; Address: 559 Nathan Abbott Way, Stanford, CA 94305; Tel: 650-723-9560; Fax: 650725-0253; Email: dho@law.stanford.edu, URL: http://dho.stanford.edu. \u030a James C.
