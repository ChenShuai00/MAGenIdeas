We provide evidence that assignment to small sections closed a slight (but substantively and highly statistically significant) gender gap existing in large sections from 2001 to 2008; that reforms in 2008 that modified the grading system and instituted small graded writing and simulationintensive courses eliminated the gap entirely; and that women, if anything, outperformed men in small simulation-based courses.
