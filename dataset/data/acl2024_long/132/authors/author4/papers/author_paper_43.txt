    "abstract": "This annual special issue of the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies ( JELS) celebrates the Seventh Annual Conference on Empirical Legal Studies (CELS), held at Stanford Law School on November 9\u201310, 2012. There is much to celebrate. CELS received nearly 360 submissions for peer review, resulting in 103 paper presentations (each with individual discussants) and 24 poster presentations. Some 340 individuals from across the globe attended the conference. Indeed, empirical work has left few fields of law untouched, as the left panel of Figure 1, plotting submissions by field, demonstrates. Of course, some areas are subject to greater empirical scrutiny. Corporate governance and finance, criminal justice, law and psychology, and law and politics, in particular, drew the largest number of submissions, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of empirical work pertaining to law. The right panel of Figure 1 plots the acceptance rate by topic\u2014while there is some variability, the rates are comparable across fields (p value = 0.66). And, as highlighted by the Stanford Law Review issue on the \u201cEmpirical Revolution in Law,\u201d this empirical movement in law is distinguished by its pervasiveness, engaging a wide range of scholars who do not necessarily produce primary empirical work themselves. This issue is a capstone to CELS, publishing a select group of papers initially presented at the conference. Just how select are they? And do the \u201cbest\u201d or published papers,"
