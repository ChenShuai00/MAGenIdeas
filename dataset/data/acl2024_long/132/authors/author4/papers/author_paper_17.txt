    "abstract": "4 While many have documented the changing demographics of universities, understanding 5 the effects of prohibiting mandatory retirement (\u201cuncapping\u201d) has proved challenging. We 6 digitize detailed directories of all American law school faculty from 1971-2017 and show that 7 uncapping in 1994 had dramatic effects. From 1971 to 1993, the percent of faculty above 70 8 \u2013 when mandatory retirement would typically have been triggered \u2013 remained stable at 1%, 9 but starting in 1994, that proportion increased to 14%. We use a permutation test of moving 10 cohorts to show that these increases are attributable to uncapping. Roughly 39% of faculty 11 members would counterfactually have been subject to mandatory retirement. Effects were 12 less pronounced at public schools, which were more likely to have defined benefits retirement 13 plans. Second, we show that schools with the highest proportion of faculty over 70, and thus 14 most impacted by uncapping, also exhibit the slowest integration of female and minority fac15 ulty members. Our study highlights cross-cutting effects of civil rights laws: preventing age 16 discrimination can have collateral effects on racial and gender integration. 17 \u2217We thank Claire Greenberg for helpful research assistance, Brandon Anderson, Abhay Aneja, Dick Buxbaum, Lawrence Friedman, Sandy Handan-Nader, Dan Hulsebosch, Anne Joseph O\u2019Connell, Pam Karlan, Jenny Martinez, Goodwin Liu, Jess Saunders, Laura Trice, and participants at the faculty workshop at Berkeley Law for helpful comments and conversations, Alain Kelder, Jason Watson, and Beth Williams for help in digitizing the AALS volumes, and Amy Applebaum for sharing demographic reports on the entry-level hiring pool. 1"
