    "Title": "Self-Supervised Prompt Compression via Latent Semantic Mapping",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a self-supervised learning approach to prompt compression, where the model learns to map prompts to a latent semantic space that captures the most critical information. The compressed prompt is then generated by reconstructing the original prompt from this latent space, ensuring that key information is preserved. This method eliminates the need for labeled data, making it more scalable and applicable to a wide range of tasks. The latent semantic mapping also allows for better generalization to unseen prompts, improving the robustness of the compression process.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Carnap’s inductive logic** (Methodology 5: Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies), which focuses on identifying patterns and structures in data. By mapping prompts to a latent semantic space, we can capture the underlying structure of the information, enabling more effective compression. **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is also used to refine the self-supervised learning process, ensuring that the method is both efficient and accurate. The hypothesis is that self-supervised learning can outperform supervised methods by leveraging the inherent structure of the data.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that supervised prompt compression methods require labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. By using a self-supervised approach, we can eliminate this requirement, making the method more scalable and applicable to a wide range of tasks. The latent semantic mapping also ensures that the compressed prompt retains the most critical information, improving both efficiency and performance. Its potential to revolutionize prompt compression makes it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
