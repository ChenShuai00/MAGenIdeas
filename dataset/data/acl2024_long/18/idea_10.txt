    "Title": "Dynamic Prompt Compression with Adaptive Contextual Relevance",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic prompt compression method that adapts the compression ratio based on the contextual relevance of different parts of the input. Unlike static compression methods, this approach uses a relevance scoring mechanism to identify and prioritize key information in the prompt, ensuring that the most important parts are preserved while less relevant sections are compressed more aggressively. The method leverages a lightweight neural network trained to predict the relevance of each token in the prompt, allowing for real-time adaptation of the compression strategy. This approach aims to further reduce computational costs and latency while maintaining or even improving model performance in long-context scenarios.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Design and Improve Existing Methods' theory (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) and 'Exploring the Limitations and Shortcomings of Current Methods' theory (Popper’s falsificationism). The target paper, LongLLMLingua, already introduces a prompt compression method, but it uses a static compression ratio. By identifying the limitation of static compression, this idea proposes a dynamic approach that adapts to the content of the prompt, potentially improving efficiency and performance. The relevance scoring mechanism is a new hypothesis generated using 'Propose New Hypotheses' theory (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method).",
    "Rationale": "The rationale behind this idea is that not all parts of a prompt are equally important for the model's performance. By dynamically adjusting the compression ratio based on contextual relevance, the method can preserve critical information while aggressively compressing less important sections. This approach could lead to further reductions in computational costs and latency, making it highly relevant for applications that require real-time processing of long contexts. Additionally, the use of a lightweight neural network ensures that the method can be implemented efficiently without adding significant overhead.",
