    "title": "NERVE: Real-Time Neural Video Recovery and Enhancement on Mobile Devices",
    "abstract": "As mobile devices become increasingly popular for video streaming, it is crucial to optimize the streaming experience for these devices. Although deep learning-based video enhancement techniques are gaining attention, most of them cannot support real-time enhancement on mobile devices. Additionally, many of these techniques are focused solely on super-resolution and cannot handle partial or complete loss or corruption of video frames, which is common in the Internet and wireless networks. To overcome these challenges, we present NERVE, a novel approach in this paper. NERVE consists of (i) a novel video frame recovery scheme, (ii) a new super-resolution algorithm, and (iii) an enhancement-aware video bit rate adaptation algorithm. We implement NERVE on an iPhone 12, and it can support 30 frames per second (FPS). We evaluate NERVE in various networks such as 3G, 4G, 5G, and WiFi networks. Our evaluation shows that NERVE enables real-time video recovery and enhancement, and results in 24% - 83% increase in video Quality of Experience (QoE) in our video streaming system."
