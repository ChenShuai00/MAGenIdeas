    "title": "Online Streaming Video Super-Resolution With Convolutional Look-Up Table",
    "abstract": "Online video streaming has fundamental limitations on the transmission bandwidth and computational capacity and super-resolution is a promising potential solution. However, applying existing video super-resolution methods to online streaming is non-trivial. Existing video codecs and streaming protocols (e.g., WebRTC) dynamically change the video quality both spatially and temporally, which leads to diverse and dynamic degradations. Furthermore, online streaming has a strict requirement for latency that most existing methods are less applicable. As a result, this paper focuses on the rarely exploited problem setting of online streaming video super resolution. To facilitate the research on this problem, a new benchmark dataset named LDV-WebRTC is constructed based on a real-world online streaming system. Leveraging the new benchmark dataset, we propose a novel method specifically for online video streaming, which contains a convolution and Look-Up Table (LUT) hybrid model to achieve better performance-latency trade-off. To tackle the changing degradations, we propose a mixture-of-expert-LUT module, where a set of LUT specialized in different degradations are built and adaptively combined to handle different degradations. Experiments show our method achieves 720P video SR around 100 FPS, while significantly outperforms existing LUT-based methods and offers competitive performance compared to efficient CNN-based methods.
