    "title": "Online Video Streaming Super-Resolution with Adaptive Look-Up Table Fusion",
    "abstract": "\u2014This paper focuses on Super-resolution for online video streaming data. Applying existing super-resolution methods to video streaming data is non-trivial for two reasons. First, to support application with constant interactions, video streaming has a high requirement for latency that most existing methods are less applicable, especially on low-end devices. Second, existing video streaming protocols ( e.g. , WebRTC) dynamically adapt the video quality to the network condition, thus video streaming in the wild varies greatly under different network bandwidths, which leads to diverse and dynamic degradations. To tackle the above two challenges, we proposed a novel video super-resolution method for online video streaming. First, we incorporate Look-Up Table (LUT) to lightweight convolution modules to achieve real-time latency. Second, for variant degradations, we propose a pixel-level LUT fusion strategy, where a set of LUT bases are built upon state-of-the-art SR networks pre-trained on different degraded data, and those LUT bases are combined with extracted weights from lightweight convolution modules to adaptively handle dynamic degradations. Extensive experiments are conducted on a newly proposed online video streaming dataset named LDV-WebRTC. All the results show that our method signi\ufb01cantly outperforms existing LUT-based methods and offers competitive SR performance with faster speed compared to ef\ufb01cient CNN-based methods. Accelerated with our parallel LUT inference, our proposed method can even support online 720P video SR around 100 FPS."
