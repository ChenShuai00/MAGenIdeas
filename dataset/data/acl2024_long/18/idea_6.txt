    "Title": "Hierarchical Prompt Compression for Multi-Level Context Understanding",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a hierarchical prompt compression method that compresses prompts at multiple levels of granularity. The method first identifies high-level themes and key concepts in the prompt and then compresses the prompt at a coarse level. Subsequently, it performs fine-grained compression within each identified theme, ensuring that detailed information is retained where necessary. This hierarchical approach allows for more efficient compression while preserving the overall context and key details, leading to improved LLM performance in long-context scenarios.",
    "Thinking": "The idea is based on Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory, which emphasizes the importance of identifying common patterns and structures. By applying this theory, we can develop a hierarchical compression method that captures both high-level themes and fine-grained details. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the prompt, leading to better compression and improved performance. The method also draws on Laudan’s methodological improvement model, which suggests integrating new technologies and tools to improve existing methods. In this case, the hierarchical approach represents a novel integration of multi-level compression techniques.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current prompt compression methods often treat the prompt as a single, monolithic entity, which may not be optimal for capturing the full context. By compressing prompts at multiple levels of granularity, we can ensure that both high-level themes and detailed information are retained, leading to more accurate and efficient LLM inference. This hierarchical approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of LLMs in long-context scenarios, making it a promising area of research.",
