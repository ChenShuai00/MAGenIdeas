    "Title": "Hierarchical Prompt Compression for Multi-Level Context Understanding",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a hierarchical prompt compression framework that processes prompts at multiple levels of granularity. The framework first identifies high-level themes and key concepts in the prompt, then compresses the prompt hierarchically by preserving these themes while reducing redundant details. This approach enables LLMs to focus on the most relevant information at each level, improving both efficiency and performance. The hierarchical structure also allows for better handling of complex, multi-faceted prompts, which are common in long-context scenarios.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** (Methodology 5: Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies), which emphasizes identifying common patterns and structures. By analyzing prompts at multiple levels of granularity, we can uncover underlying themes and compress the prompt more effectively. **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** is also applied to refine the compression process, ensuring that the hierarchical approach is both efficient and accurate. The hypothesis is that hierarchical compression will outperform flat compression methods, as it aligns more closely with how humans process complex information.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that long-context prompts often contain multiple layers of information, and flat compression methods may fail to capture the hierarchical structure. By compressing prompts hierarchically, we can preserve the most relevant information while reducing computational cost. This approach is particularly useful for tasks that require deep understanding of complex prompts, such as multi-document question answering or summarization. Its potential to significantly improve LLM performance in long-context scenarios makes it a strong contender for best paper awards.",
