    "Title": "Meta-Analogical Reasoning: A Framework for Cross-Domain Analogical Generalization in Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a meta-analogical reasoning framework that enables language models to generalize analogical reasoning across domains by learning meta-patterns from diverse analogy datasets. The framework integrates ANALOGYKB with a meta-learning architecture that identifies high-level relational structures (e.g., 'cause-effect', 'part-whole') across different domains. By training on a diverse set of analogies, the model learns to transfer analogical reasoning skills to unseen domains, improving its ability to handle complex, cross-domain analogies. The framework also includes a self-supervised component where the model generates its own analogies to refine its understanding of relational patterns.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (identifying gaps in current analogical reasoning) and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (using creative leaps to propose new hypotheses). The meta-learning approach aligns with **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**, as it abstracts general laws from multiple analogy datasets. The self-supervised component is influenced by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, as it refines the model’s ability to generate and evaluate analogies.",
    "Rationale": "Current language models struggle with cross-domain analogical reasoning due to their reliance on domain-specific training data. By learning meta-patterns, the model can generalize its reasoning skills, making it more robust and versatile. This approach has the potential to significantly improve performance on tasks requiring abstract reasoning, such as scientific discovery, creative writing, and problem-solving.",
