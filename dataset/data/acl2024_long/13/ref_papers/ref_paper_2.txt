    "title": "Fluid Transformers and Creative Analogies: Exploring Large Language Models\u2019 Capacity for Augmenting Cross-Domain Analogical Creativity",
    "abstract": "Cross-domain analogical reasoning is a core creative ability that can be challenging for humans. Recent work has shown some proofs-of-concept of Large language Models\u2019 (LLMs) ability to generate cross-domain analogies. However, the reliability and potential usefulness of this capacity for augmenting human creative work has received little systematic exploration. In this paper, we systematically explore LLMs capacity to augment cross-domain analogical reasoning. Across three studies, we found: 1) LLM-generated cross-domain analogies were frequently judged as helpful in the context of a problem reformulation task (median 4 out of 5 helpfulness rating), and frequently (\u223c 80% of cases) led to observable changes in problem formulations, and 2) there was an upper bound of \u223c 25% of outputs being rated as potentially harmful, with a majority due to potentially upsetting content, rather than biased or toxic content. These results demonstrate the potential utility \u2014 and risks \u2014 of LLMs for augmenting cross-domain analogical creativity."
