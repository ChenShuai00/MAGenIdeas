    "Title": "Dynamic AnalogyKB: A Self-Evolving Knowledge Base for Real-Time Analogical Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea extends ANALOGYKB by introducing a dynamic, self-evolving knowledge base that continuously updates itself with new analogies discovered in real-time data streams (e.g., social media, scientific literature). The system uses a combination of unsupervised learning and human-in-the-loop validation to identify and integrate new analogies into the KB. The dynamic KB is paired with a reinforcement learning module that evaluates the utility of each analogy in downstream tasks, ensuring that only high-quality analogies are retained. This approach enables language models to stay up-to-date with evolving knowledge and improve their analogical reasoning capabilities over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions** (adapting to new knowledge paradigms) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (refining methods based on real-time feedback). The reinforcement learning component is inspired by **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, as it involves iterative hypothesis testing and refinement.",
    "Rationale": "Static knowledge bases like ANALOGYKB may become outdated as new knowledge emerges. A dynamic, self-evolving KB ensures that language models can leverage the most recent and relevant analogies, improving their performance in real-world applications. This approach is particularly valuable for domains where knowledge evolves rapidly, such as medicine, technology, and social sciences.",
