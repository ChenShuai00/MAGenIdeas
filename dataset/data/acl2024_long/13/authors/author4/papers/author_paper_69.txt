    "abstract": "Multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is still a serious threat to global health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new antibacterial agents based on virulence factor therapy to overcome drug resistance. Previously, we synthesized SYG-180-2-2 (C21H16N2OSe), an effective small molecule compound against biofilm. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-virulence efficacy of SYG-180-2-2 against Staphylococcus aureus. MIC results demonstrated no apparent antibacterial activity of the SYG-180-2-2. The growth curve assay showed that SYG-180-2-2 had nonlethal effect on S. aureus. Besides, SYG-180-2-2 strongly inhibited the hemolytic activity and staphyloxanthin synthesis in S. aureus. Inhibition of staphyloxanthin by SYG-180-2-2 enhanced the sensitivity of S. aureus to oxidants and human whole blood. In addition, SYG-180-2-2 significantly decreased the expression of saeR-mediated hemolytic gene hlb and staphyloxanthin-related crtM, crtN and sigB genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Meanwhile, the expression of oxidative stress-related genes sodA, sodM and katA also decreased. Galleria Mellonella assay revealed that SYG-180-2-2 was not toxic to larvae. Further, the larvae infection model showed that the virulence of bacteria was significantly reduced after 4 \u03bcg/mL SYG-180-2-2 treatment. SYG-180-2-2 also reduced skin abscess formation in mice by reducing bacterial burden and subcutaneous inflammation. In conclusion, SYG-180-2-2 might be a promising agent to attenuate the virulence of S. aureus by targeting genes associated with hemolytic activity and staphyloxanthin synthesis."
