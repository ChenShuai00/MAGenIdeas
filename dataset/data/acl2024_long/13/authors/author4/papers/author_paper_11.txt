    "abstract": "ABSTRACT ST22 MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) strains are only sporadically reported in China. Through the phylogenetic reconstruction of 30 ST22 strains from China and 480 ST22 strains from global sources, we found that the global ST22 strains can be divided into three clades (I, II, and III). The China ST22 strains were found primarily in clade II (IIb and IIc) and also in clade III, indicating that the China ST22-MRSA clones have different origins. The China subclade IIb strains (SCCmec Vb-t309) may evolve from the native ST22 MSSA clone, while the China IIc strains may have spread from other countries. Subclade IIc (SCCmecIVa-t309) strains exhibited particularly strong lethality and invasiveness in Galleria mellonella infection and mouse skin abscess models in comparison to USA300 and other dominant China HA-MRSA (ST5 and ST239) or CA-MRSA (ST59) strains. This study described the emergence of a highly virulent ST22 MRSA subclade and improved our insight into the molecular epidemiology of ST22 strains in China. IMPORTANCE ST22 is a successful hospital-associated MRSA lineage which first appeared in the United Kingdom as EMRSA-15. At present, ST22 MRSA clones are spreading rapidly around the world and even replaced other dominant clones in some regions. We placed the Chinese ST22 in the worldwide phylogeny of ST22, demonstrating a distinctive molecular epidemiology and to our knowledge, this is the first time that a novel clade of ST22 has been found in China. Among the 15 ST22 MRSA strains belonging to the novel clade, 14 ST22 SCCmecIVa strains from different regions carried both pvl and tst and displayed significantly higher in vitro and in vivo virulence in comparison to other clade/subclade ST22 strains as well as other common China HA-MRSA or CA-MRSA strains. The further spread of this subclade of strains could pose a serious threat to the health system in China and other regions.
