    "title": "GANTEE: Generative Adversarial Network for Taxonomy Enterance Evaluation",
    "abstract": "Taxonomy is formulated as directed acyclic graphs or trees of concepts that support many downstream tasks.\nMany new coming concepts need to be added to an existing taxonomy.\nThe traditional taxonomy expansion task aims only at finding the best position for new coming concepts in the existing taxonomy. \nHowever, they have two drawbacks when being applied to the real-scenarios.\nThe previous methods suffer from low-efficiency since they waste much time when most of the new coming concepts are indeed noisy concepts. They also suffer from low-effectiveness since they collect training samples only from the existing taxonomy, which limits the ability of the model to mine more hypernym-hyponym relationships among real concepts.\nThis paper proposes a pluggable framework called Generative Adversarial Network for Taxonomy Entering Evaluation (GANTEE) to alleviate these drawbacks.\nA generative adversarial network is designed in this framework by discriminative models to alleviate the first drawback and the generative model to alleviate the second drawback.\nTwo discriminators are used in GANTEE to provide long-term and short-term rewards, respectively.\nMoreover, to further improve the efficiency, pre-trained language models are used to retrieve the representation of the concepts quickly.\nThe experiments on three real-world large-scale datasets with two different languages show that GANTEE improves the performance of the existing taxonomy expansion methods in both effectiveness and efficiency."
