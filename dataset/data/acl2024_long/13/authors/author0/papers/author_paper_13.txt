    "abstract": "Can Large Language Models (LLMs) substitute humans in making important decisions? Recent research has unveiled the potential of LLMs to role-play assigned personas, mimicking their knowledge and linguistic habits. However, imitative decision-making necessitates a more nuanced understanding of per-sonas. In this paper, we benchmark the ability of LLMs in persona-driven decision-making. Specifically, we investigate whether LLMs can predict characters\u2019 decisions provided with the preceding stories in high-quality novels. Leveraging character analyses written by literary experts, we construct a dataset L IFE - C HOICE comprising 1,401 character decision points from 395 books. Then, we conduct comprehensive experiments on L IFE C HOICE , with various LLMs and methods for LLM role-playing. The results demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit promising capabilities in this task, yet substantial room for improvement remains. Hence, we further pro-pose the C HAR M AP method, which achieves a 6.01% increase in accuracy via persona-based memory retrieval. We will make our datasets and code publicly available."
