    "title": "Energy absorbency and phase stability during NaCl solution icing",
    "abstract": "Deeper insight into the functionality of salt solute on tuning the energy absorbency R and the freezing temperature TN during phase transition is pivotal to many subject areas. Here we show that NaCl solvation turns the fS = nhC portion molecules into the hydrating supersolid phase by ionic polarization and leaves the rest fO = 1 \u2013 nhC portion ordinary. The C is the solute molar concentration and nh the number of molecules saturating the hydration per pair of Na + + Cl solute. Polarization shortens and stiffens the H\u2013O bond and does the O:H nonbond contrastingly in the supersolid. Water absorbs energy by H\u2013O cooling contraction in the quasisolid phase during the process of Liquid\u2013 Quasisolid\u2013Ice transition. The solution R drops with the fO loss till zero corresponding to C = 0.1 and nh = 10 that saturates the solvation per solute at least. The polarization-weakening of the O:H nonbonds lowers the TN < 253 K of the supersolid phase. 1 College of Geology and Environment, Xi'an University of Science and Technology, Xi'an 710054, China (shenyj@xust.edu.cn; 19204053043@stu.xust.edu.cn) 2 Department of Geotechnical Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China (yongzhi_wang@tongji.edu.cn) EBEAM, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yangtze Normal University, Chongqing 408100, China (Lilei@yznu.edu.cn) 4 Key Laboratory of Low-dimensional Materials and Application Technology and School of Materials Science and Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan 411105, China (Huangyongli@xtu.edu.cn) 5 School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798, Singapore (ecqsun@ntu.edu.sg; corresponding author)"
