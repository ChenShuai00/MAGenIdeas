    "title": "AgentGroupChat: An Interactive Group Chat Simulacra For Better Eliciting Emergent Behavior",
    "abstract": "Language significantly influences the formation and evolution of Human emergent behavior, which is crucial in understanding collective intelligence within human societies. Considering that the study of how language affects human behavior needs to put it into the dynamic scenarios in which it is used, we introduce AgentGroupChat in this paper, a simulation that delves into the complex role of language in shaping collective behavior through interactive debate scenarios. Central to this simulation are characters engaging in dynamic conversation interactions. To enable simulation, we introduce the Verbal Strategist Agent, utilizing large language models to enhance interaction strategies by incorporating elements of persona and action. We set four narrative scenarios based on AgentGroupChat to demonstrate the simulation's capacity to mimic complex language use in group dynamics. Evaluations focus on aligning agent behaviors with human expectations and the emergence of collective behaviors within the simulation. Results reveal that emergent behaviors materialize from a confluence of factors: a conducive environment for extensive information exchange, characters with diverse traits, high linguistic comprehension, and strategic adaptability. During discussions on ``the impact of AI on humanity'' in AgentGroupChat simulation, philosophers commonly agreed that ``AI could enhance societal welfare with judicious limitations'' and even come to a conclusion that ``the essence of true intelligence encompasses understanding the necessity to constrain self abilities''. Additionally, in the competitive domain of casting for primary roles in films in AgentGroupChat, certain actors were ready to reduce their remuneration or accept lesser roles, motivated by their deep-seated desire to contribute to the project."
