    "abstract": "Quantities are distinct and critical components of texts that characterize the magnitude properties of entities, providing a precise perspective for the understanding of natural language, especially for reasoning tasks. In recent years, there has been a flurry of research on reasoning tasks based on large language models (LLMs), most of which solely focus on numerical values, neglecting the dimensional concept of quantities with units despite its importance. We argue that the concept of dimension is essential for precisely understanding quantities and of great significance for LLMs to perform quantitative reasoning. However, the lack of dimension knowledge and quantity-related benchmarks has resulted in low performance of LLMs. Hence, we present a framework to enhance the quantitative reasoning ability of language models based on dimension perception. We first construct a dimensional unit knowledge base (DimUnitKB) to address the knowledge gap in this area. We propose a benchmark DimEval consisting of seven tasks of three categories to probe and enhance the dimension perception skills of LLMs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we propose a quantitative reasoning task and conduct experiments. The experimental results show that our dimension perception method dramatically improves accuracy (43.55%\u219250.67%) on quantitative reasoning tasks compared to GPT-4."
