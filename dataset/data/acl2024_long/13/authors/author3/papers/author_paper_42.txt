    "title": "Prototypical Concept Representation",
    "abstract": "Concepts are building blocks of human thinking. For machines, concept understanding has also been increasingly important, which makes concept representation a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. While many concepts have their instances, the massive amount of information carried by instances has long been ignored in current concept representation, which limits the usage of these concepts in applications. In this paper, inspired by prototype theory in cognitive science, we propose prototypical concept representation for machines, which represents each concept with a distributed prototype derived from representations of its instances. For prototypical representation learning, we further introduce a novel model named Prototypical Siamese Network (PSN). PSN is trained under the supervision of isA determination, one of the most important concept-related applications. Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, thus validating the effectiveness of prototypical concept representation."
