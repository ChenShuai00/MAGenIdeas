    "title": "CN-DBpedia2: An Extraction and Verification Framework for Enriching Chinese Encyclopedia Knowledge Base",
    "abstract": "Knowledge base plays an important role in machine understanding and has been widely used in various applications, such as search engine, recommendation system and question answering. However, most knowledge bases are incomplete, which can cause many downstream applications to perform poorly because they cannot find the corresponding facts in the knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose an extraction and verification framework to enrich the knowledge bases. Specifically, based on the existing knowledge base, we first extract new facts from the description texts of entities. But not all newly-formed facts can be added directly to the knowledge base because the errors might be involved by the extraction. Then we propose a novel crowd-sourcing based verification step to verify the candidate facts. Finally, we apply this framework to the existing knowledge base CN-DBpedia and construct a new version of knowledge base CN-DBpedia2, which additionally contains the high confidence facts extracted from the description texts of entities."
