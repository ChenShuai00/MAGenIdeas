    "Title": "Human-in-the-Loop Analogical Reasoning with Interactive LMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes the development of interactive LMs that can perform analogical reasoning in collaboration with human users. The LMs would be trained on ANALOGYKB and would use a human-in-the-loop approach to refine their analogical reasoning capabilities. The idea includes a user interface that allows users to provide feedback on the LM's analogies, suggest new analogies, and explore the reasoning process. The LM would use this feedback to improve its performance over time, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant analogies. The idea also includes a benchmarking framework that evaluates the performance of interactive LMs on analogical reasoning tasks, using metrics such as user satisfaction, accuracy, and adaptability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method and Laudan’s methodological improvement model. Pierce’s method emphasizes the importance of generating hypotheses and testing them, which aligns with the idea of using human feedback to refine the LM's analogical reasoning. Laudan’s model suggests that scientific progress often comes from improving existing methods, which is relevant to the idea of enhancing the interactivity of LMs. The idea also draws on Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions, as it proposes a shift in how analogical reasoning is modeled, moving from fully automated models to interactive ones that collaborate with humans.",
    "Rationale": "Human-in-the-loop approaches have been shown to improve the performance of AI systems in various tasks, but they have not been widely applied to analogical reasoning. By developing interactive LMs that can collaborate with human users, this idea addresses a significant gap in the field and has the potential to improve the accuracy and relevance of analogical reasoning in real-world applications. The idea is highly relevant to top conferences like ACL and NeurIPS, where human-AI collaboration is an active area of research.",
