    "Title": "Analogical Reasoning as a Service: A Scalable Cloud Platform for On-Demand Analogical Inference",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a cloud-based platform that provides analogical reasoning as a service (ARaaS) to developers and researchers. The platform leverages ANALOGYKB and state-of-the-art language models to offer on-demand analogical inference capabilities via a simple API. Users can submit queries (e.g., 'Find an analogy for X in domain Y') and receive high-quality analogies in real-time. The platform also includes tools for customizing the KB (e.g., adding domain-specific analogies) and evaluating the performance of analogical reasoning models. By democratizing access to advanced analogical reasoning tools, this platform aims to accelerate innovation in AI and NLP.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (scaling and refining methods for broader use) and **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions** (enabling a paradigm shift in how analogical reasoning is accessed and applied). The service-oriented approach is inspired by **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, as it involves iterative testing and refinement based on user feedback.",
    "Rationale": "Despite the importance of analogical reasoning, there is currently no scalable, user-friendly platform for accessing these capabilities. By providing ARaaS, this idea lowers the barrier to entry for researchers and developers, enabling them to integrate advanced analogical reasoning into their applications without needing to build and maintain their own infrastructure.",
