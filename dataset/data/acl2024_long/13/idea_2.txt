    "Title": "Explainable Analogical Reasoning: Generating Human-Interpretable Explanations for LM Decisions",
    "Idea": "This idea focuses on enhancing the interpretability of analogical reasoning in language models by generating human-readable explanations for their decisions. The system integrates ANALOGYKB with a neural-symbolic framework that maps analogical reasoning steps to symbolic representations (e.g., logic rules or semantic graphs). These representations are then translated into natural language explanations, providing users with insights into how the model arrived at its conclusions. The framework also includes an evaluation module that assesses the quality of explanations based on human feedback, ensuring that they are both accurate and understandable.",
    "Thinking": "This idea draws on **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** (abstracting general laws from specific cases) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (refining methods based on feedback). The neural-symbolic approach is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, as it bridges the gap between symbolic and neural paradigms in AI.",
    "Rationale": "Explainability is a critical challenge in AI, particularly for complex tasks like analogical reasoning. By providing human-interpretable explanations, this approach increases user trust and facilitates the adoption of language models in high-stakes applications, such as education, healthcare, and legal reasoning.",
