    "Title": "Multimodal AnalogyKB: Integrating Text, Images, and Knowledge Graphs for Cross-Modal Analogical Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea extends ANALOGYKB to support multimodal analogical reasoning by integrating text, images, and knowledge graphs. The system uses a multimodal transformer architecture to encode information from different modalities into a shared embedding space, enabling the model to identify analogies across text and images. For example, the model could recognize that the relationship between 'king' and 'crown' in text is analogous to the relationship between 'lion' and 'mane' in images. The framework also includes a cross-modal alignment module that ensures consistency between modalities, improving the model’s ability to generalize across domains.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (exploring new paradigms for analogical reasoning) and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (using creative leaps to propose cross-modal analogies). The multimodal approach aligns with **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**, as it abstracts general patterns across different modalities.",
    "Rationale": "Current analogical reasoning systems are limited to single modalities, restricting their applicability in real-world scenarios where information is often multimodal. By integrating text, images, and knowledge graphs, this approach enables more robust and versatile analogical reasoning, with applications in areas like education, creative design, and multimedia analysis.",
