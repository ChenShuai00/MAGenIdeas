    "Title": "Faithfulness and Plausibility: A Dual Evaluation Framework for LLM Explanations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dual evaluation framework that measures both the faithfulness and plausibility of LLM-generated explanations. While faithfulness evaluates whether the explanation reflects the model's internal reasoning, plausibility assesses whether the explanation is coherent and understandable to humans. The framework will involve: (1) developing metrics for both faithfulness (e.g., CC-SHAP) and plausibility (e.g., human evaluation), (2) conducting experiments to measure the trade-offs between faithfulness and plausibility, and (3) proposing methods to optimize both aspects in LLM explanations.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of **Define New Scientific Problems** and **Scientific Paradigm Shift**. The target paper focuses on faithfulness, but this idea expands the scope to include plausibility, which is also critical for interpretability. By proposing a dual evaluation framework, this idea addresses a broader set of challenges in LLM interpretability, aligning with the need for a paradigm shift in how we evaluate explanations.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that while faithfulness is important, explanations must also be plausible to be useful in practice. This dual evaluation framework addresses both aspects, providing a more comprehensive assessment of LLM explanations. This idea has the potential to significantly impact the field of AI interpretability, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at conferences like ACL and NeurIPS."
