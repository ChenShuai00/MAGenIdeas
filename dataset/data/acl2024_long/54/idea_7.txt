    "Title": "Faithfulness-through-Intervention: A Causal Framework for Evaluating LLM Explanations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a causal framework for evaluating the faithfulness of LLM explanations by intervening on the model's internal representations. The framework would use techniques like activation patching, gradient-based interventions, and attention manipulation to alter specific reasoning steps in the model and measure how the explanations and predictions change. If the explanations remain consistent with the model's reasoning under intervention, they are deemed faithful. The framework would also include a benchmark suite of tasks designed to test causal faithfulness, such as logical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and multi-hop question answering.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Design and Improve Existing Methods (Hacking’s experimental system theory)** and **Scientific Paradigm Shift (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions)**. The target paper critiques existing faithfulness tests for being output-oriented and proposes CC-SHAP as a fine-grained measure. However, CC-SHAP does not directly probe the model's internal reasoning. By introducing causal interventions, this idea pushes the evaluation closer to the model's reasoning process, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how faithfulness is measured.",
    "Rationale": "Current faithfulness tests, including CC-SHAP, are limited by their focus on output-level consistency. Causal interventions provide a more direct way to evaluate whether explanations reflect the model's reasoning process, addressing a key limitation. This approach is novel and has the potential to significantly advance the field of explainability by providing a more rigorous and interpretable evaluation framework. It also addresses the growing need for trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes applications, making it highly relevant for top conferences."
