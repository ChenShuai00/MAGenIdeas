    "Title": "Faithfulness-as-a-Service: A Platform for Real-Time Faithfulness Evaluation of LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a cloud-based platform, Faithfulness-as-a-Service (FaaS), that provides real-time evaluation of the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations. The platform will integrate metrics like CC-SHAP and counterfactual-based evaluation into a user-friendly interface, allowing developers and researchers to upload model outputs and receive detailed faithfulness reports. The platform will also include a benchmarking suite to compare different models and explanation methods. The goal is to make faithfulness evaluation accessible to a wider audience and promote the development of more interpretable AI systems.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of **Design and Improve Existing Methods** and **Propose New Hypotheses**. The target paper highlights the need for better faithfulness evaluation methods, and this idea addresses that by creating a practical tool for real-time evaluation. The platform leverages existing metrics like CC-SHAP but makes them more accessible, aligning with the need for methodological improvement and practical application.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that while there are many metrics for evaluating faithfulness, they are often difficult to implement and use in practice. FaaS addresses this by providing a centralized platform for real-time evaluation, making it easier for developers and researchers to assess the interpretability of their models. This idea has the potential to significantly impact the AI community, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at conferences like ICLR and ACL."
