    "Title": "Faithfulness-through-Counterfactuals: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Explanations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a new framework for evaluating the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations by leveraging counterfactual reasoning. The framework would generate counterfactual inputs that alter specific reasoning steps in the explanation and measure how the model's predictions change. If the model's predictions align with the counterfactual reasoning, the explanation is deemed faithful. This approach addresses the limitations of surface-level consistency tests by probing the model's internal reasoning process. The framework would include a suite of counterfactual generation techniques, such as logical perturbations, semantic substitutions, and adversarial examples, to test the robustness of explanations across diverse tasks and models.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Exploring the Limitations and Shortcomings of Current Methods (Popper’s falsificationism)** and **Design and Improve Existing Methods (Laudan’s methodological improvement model)**. The target paper critiques existing faithfulness tests for being surface-level and proposes CC-SHAP as a fine-grained measure. However, CC-SHAP still operates at the output level. By introducing counterfactual reasoning, this idea pushes the evaluation closer to the model's internal reasoning, addressing a key limitation. The framework also aligns with **Propose New Hypotheses (Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving)**, as it hypothesizes that counterfactual reasoning can better capture faithfulness.",
    "Rationale": "Current faithfulness tests, including CC-SHAP, focus on self-consistency rather than true faithfulness. Counterfactual reasoning provides a more direct way to probe the model's reasoning process, as it tests whether the model's predictions are logically consistent with the explanation under altered conditions. This approach is novel and has the potential to significantly advance the field of explainability by providing a more rigorous and interpretable evaluation framework. It also addresses the growing need for trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes applications, making it highly relevant for top conferences."
