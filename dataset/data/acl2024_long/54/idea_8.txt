    "Title": "Faithfulness-as-Interpretability: A Framework for Aligning Explanations with Model Internals",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework for aligning LLM-generated explanations with the model's internal representations, such as attention weights, gradients, and hidden states. The framework would use techniques like representation similarity analysis, gradient-based attribution, and attention visualization to measure the alignment between explanations and model internals. If the explanations are well-aligned with the model's internal reasoning, they are deemed faithful. The framework would also include a benchmark suite of tasks designed to test interpretability alignment, such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and question answering.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Construct and Modify Theoretical Models (Lakoff’s conceptual metaphor theory)** and **Design and Improve Existing Methods (Laudan’s methodological improvement model)**. The target paper critiques existing faithfulness tests for being output-oriented and proposes CC-SHAP as a fine-grained measure. However, CC-SHAP does not directly evaluate the alignment between explanations and model internals. By introducing interpretability alignment, this idea pushes the evaluation closer to the model's reasoning process, potentially leading to a more rigorous and interpretable framework.",
    "Rationale": "Current faithfulness tests, including CC-SHAP, are limited by their focus on output-level consistency. Interpretability alignment provides a more direct way to evaluate whether explanations reflect the model's reasoning process, addressing a key limitation. This approach is novel and has the potential to significantly advance the field of explainability by providing a more rigorous and interpretable evaluation framework. It also addresses the growing need for trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes applications, making it highly relevant for top conferences."
