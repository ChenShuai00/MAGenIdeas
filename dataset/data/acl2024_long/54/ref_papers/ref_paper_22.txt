    "abstract": "In this paper, we present SemEval-2020 Task 4,CommonsenseValidation andExplanation(ComVE), which includes three subtasks, aiming to evaluate whether a system can distinguish anatural language statement thatmakes senseto humans from one that does not, and provide thereasons. Specifically, in our first subtask, the participating systems are required to choose from twonatural language statements of similar wording the one thatmakes senseand the one does not. Thesecond subtask additionally asks a system to select the key reason from three options why a givenstatement does not make sense. In the third subtask, a participating system needs to generate thereason automatically. 39 teams submitted their valid systems to at least one subtask. For SubtaskA and Subtask B, top-performing teams have achieved results closed to human performance.However, for Subtask C, there is still a considerable gap between system and human performance.The dataset used in our task can be found athttps://github.com/wangcunxiang/SemEval2020-Task4-Commonsense-Validation-and-Explanation."
