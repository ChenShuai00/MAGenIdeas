    "Title": "CC-SHAP++: Extending CC-SHAP for Multi-Modal Faithfulness Evaluation",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the CC-SHAP metric introduced in the target paper to evaluate faithfulness in multi-modal settings, such as vision-language models. The extended metric, CC-SHAP++, will measure how input features (e.g., pixels in an image and words in a caption) contribute to both the model's prediction and its explanation. The idea involves: (1) adapting CC-SHAP to handle multi-modal inputs, (2) developing a new suite of tasks to evaluate multi-modal faithfulness, and (3) comparing CC-SHAP++ with existing faithfulness metrics in multi-modal settings. The goal is to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of faithfulness in models that process both text and images.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of **Design and Improve Existing Methods** and **Scientific Paradigm Shift**. The target paper introduces CC-SHAP as a fine-grained metric for self-consistency, and this idea extends it to address the growing importance of multi-modal models in AI research. By adapting CC-SHAP to multi-modal settings, we can address a critical gap in the evaluation of faithfulness for these models, aligning with the need for a paradigm shift in how we evaluate interpretability.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that multi-modal models are increasingly being used in real-world applications, but there is a lack of robust methods to evaluate the faithfulness of their explanations. CC-SHAP++ addresses this gap by providing a unified metric for multi-modal faithfulness evaluation. This idea is highly relevant for conferences like CVPR and NeurIPS, where multi-modal models are a key focus."
