    "Title": "Faithfulness-as-Consistency: A Unified Theory for Evaluating LLM Explanations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a unified theory of faithfulness that distinguishes between different types of consistency: (1) **Surface Consistency** (e.g., self-consistency tests), (2) **Logical Consistency** (e.g., counterfactual reasoning), and (3) **Causal Consistency** (e.g., interventions on model internals). The theory would provide a taxonomy of faithfulness measures, each targeting a different level of consistency. For example, Surface Consistency would measure output-level agreement, Logical Consistency would test whether explanations align with logical reasoning, and Causal Consistency would evaluate whether explanations reflect the model's causal reasoning process. The theory would also propose new evaluation metrics for each type of consistency, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of LLM explanations.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Define New Scientific Problems (Kuhn’s paradigm theory)** and **Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies (Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory)**. The target paper critiques existing faithfulness tests for conflating self-consistency with faithfulness. By proposing a unified theory, this idea reframes the problem space and provides a structured way to evaluate explanations at multiple levels. It also synthesizes insights from related work on counterfactuals, causal reasoning, and self-consistency, creating a cohesive framework.",
    "Rationale": "The lack of a unified theory of faithfulness has led to fragmented research and inconsistent evaluation practices. By distinguishing between different types of consistency, this idea provides a clearer and more systematic way to evaluate LLM explanations. It also bridges the gap between surface-level and internal reasoning evaluations, addressing a key limitation in current methods. The theory is both novel and impactful, making it a strong candidate for top conferences."
