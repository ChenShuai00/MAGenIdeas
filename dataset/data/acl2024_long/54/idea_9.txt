    "Title": "Faithfulness-through-Explanation-Generation: A Framework for Training Faithful LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework for training LLMs to generate faithful explanations by incorporating faithfulness constraints into the training process. The framework would use techniques like adversarial training, counterfactual training, and explanation regularization to encourage the model to generate explanations that are consistent with its internal reasoning. The framework would also include a benchmark suite of tasks designed to test explanation faithfulness, such as logical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and multi-hop question answering.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Design and Improve Existing Methods (Laudan’s methodological improvement model)** and **Scientific Paradigm Shift (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions)**. The target paper critiques existing faithfulness tests for being output-oriented and proposes CC-SHAP as a fine-grained measure. However, CC-SHAP does not directly address the problem of training models to generate faithful explanations. By introducing faithfulness constraints into the training process, this idea pushes the evaluation closer to the model's reasoning process, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how faithfulness is measured.",
    "Rationale": "Current faithfulness tests, including CC-SHAP, are limited by their focus on output-level consistency. Training models to generate faithful explanations provides a more direct way to address the problem of faithfulness, addressing a key limitation. This approach is novel and has the potential to significantly advance the field of explainability by providing a more rigorous and interpretable evaluation framework. It also addresses the growing need for trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes applications, making it highly relevant for top conferences."
