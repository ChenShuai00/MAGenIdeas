    "title": "MixEval-X: Any-to-Any Evaluations from Real-World Data Mixtures",
    "abstract": "Perceiving and generating diverse modalities are crucial for AI models to effectively learn from and engage with real-world signals, necessitating reliable evaluations for their development. We identify two major issues in current evaluations: (1) inconsistent standards, shaped by different communities with varying protocols and maturity levels; and (2) significant query, grading, and generalization biases. To address these, we introduce MixEval-X, the first any-to-any, real-world benchmark designed to optimize and standardize evaluations across diverse input and output modalities. We propose multi-modal benchmark mixture and adaptation-rectification pipelines to reconstruct real-world task distributions, ensuring evaluations generalize effectively to real-world use cases. Extensive meta-evaluations show our approach effectively aligns benchmark samples with real-world task distributions. Meanwhile, MixEval-X's model rankings correlate strongly with that of crowd-sourced real-world evaluations (up to 0.98) while being much more efficient. We provide comprehensive leaderboards to rerank existing models and organizations and offer insights to enhance understanding of multi-modal evaluations and inform future research."
