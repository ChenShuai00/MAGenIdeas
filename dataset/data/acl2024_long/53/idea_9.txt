    "Title": "Zero-Shot Speech-to-Speech Translation with Disentangled Semantic Tokens",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a zero-shot speech-to-speech translation framework that leverages disentangled semantic tokens for cross-lingual transfer. The framework extends RepCodec by introducing a disentanglement mechanism that separates content, prosody, and speaker identity into distinct token streams. These tokens are then used to train a multilingual translation model that can perform zero-shot translation between unseen language pairs. The framework is pre-trained on large-scale multilingual speech data and fine-tuned for specific translation tasks, ensuring high-quality and natural-sounding translations.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions** (Scientific Paradigm Shift) and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (Propose New Hypotheses). The paradigm shift involves moving from text-based to speech-based translation, which is more natural and efficient. The hypothesis is that disentangled semantic tokens can enable zero-shot translation by preserving the essential components of speech across languages.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is the need for more natural and efficient speech-to-speech translation methods, particularly for low-resource languages. Current methods often rely on intermediate text representations, which introduce errors and inefficiencies. By leveraging disentangled semantic tokens, this framework can enable zero-shot translation, making it highly impactful and suitable for best paper awards."
