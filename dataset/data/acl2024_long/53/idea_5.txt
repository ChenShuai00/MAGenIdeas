    "Title": "Unified Cross-Modal Speech-Language Representation Learning with Disentangled Semantic Tokens",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a unified framework for learning cross-modal speech-language representations by disentangling semantic tokens into distinct components such as content, prosody, and speaker identity. The framework integrates RepCodec's vector quantization approach with a multi-task learning objective that jointly optimizes for speech understanding, generation, and cross-modal alignment. The disentangled tokens can be used to enhance LLMs by providing fine-grained control over speech synthesis and understanding, enabling applications like zero-shot speech-to-text translation, voice conversion, and personalized speech generation. The framework leverages self-supervised learning to pre-train on large-scale multilingual speech-text pairs, ensuring robustness across languages and domains.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (Define New Scientific Problems) and **Quine’s holism** (Construct and Modify Theoretical Models). The paradigm shift involves moving from single-modal speech tokenization to a unified cross-modal representation that bridges speech and text. The disentanglement of semantic tokens addresses the limitations of current methods, which often lose fine-grained information during tokenization. By integrating RepCodec with multi-task learning, the framework improves upon existing methods and opens new avenues for research in cross-modal LLMs.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the growing need for cross-modal integration in LLMs, particularly for applications like speech-to-text translation and personalized speech synthesis. Current methods often struggle with information loss and lack of fine-grained control. By disentangling semantic tokens and leveraging self-supervised learning, this framework can significantly improve the performance and versatility of LLMs in speech-related tasks, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences."
