    "Title": "Self-Supervised Speech Tokenization with Contrastive Learning and Masked Prediction",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a self-supervised learning framework for speech tokenization that combines contrastive learning and masked prediction. The framework extends RepCodec by introducing a dual-objective training process: (1) contrastive learning to maximize the similarity between semantically similar speech segments and (2) masked prediction to reconstruct masked regions of the speech signal. The resulting tokens are more robust and generalize better across languages and tasks. The framework can be pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled speech data and fine-tuned for specific applications, such as speech recognition or synthesis.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions** (Scientific Paradigm Shift) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (Design and Improve Existing Methods). The paradigm shift involves moving from supervised to self-supervised tokenization, which is more scalable and generalizable. The methodological improvement lies in the combination of contrastive learning and masked prediction, which addresses the limitations of existing self-supervised approaches.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is the need for more robust and generalizable speech tokenization methods, particularly for low-resource languages and tasks. Current methods often rely on labeled data, which is expensive to obtain. By leveraging self-supervised learning, this framework can significantly reduce the need for labeled data while improving performance, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
