    "Title": "Hierarchical Speech Tokenization for Multi-Granular Semantic Representation",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a hierarchical speech tokenization framework that captures multi-granular semantic representations, from phonemes to sentences. The framework extends RepCodec by incorporating multiple levels of vector quantization, each corresponding to a different granularity of speech. The hierarchical tokens can be used to enhance LLMs by providing richer semantic information, enabling applications like fine-grained speech editing, multi-level speech synthesis, and cross-modal alignment. The framework is trained using a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning, ensuring robustness across tasks and languages.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Quine’s holism** (Construct and Modify Theoretical Models) and **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (Define New Scientific Problems). The paradigm shift involves moving from flat tokenization to hierarchical tokenization, which captures more nuanced semantic information. The theoretical model is constructed to address the limitations of current methods, which often fail to capture multi-granular semantics.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is the need for richer semantic representations in speech tokenization, particularly for applications like speech editing and synthesis. Current methods often produce flat tokens that lose important hierarchical information. By introducing a hierarchical framework, this idea can significantly improve the performance and versatility of LLMs in speech-related tasks, making it highly impactful and suitable for top-tier conferences."
