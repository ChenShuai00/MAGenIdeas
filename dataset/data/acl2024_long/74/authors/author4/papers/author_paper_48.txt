    "title": "Deep Graph Library: Towards Efficient and Scalable Deep Learning on Graphs",
    "abstract": "Accelerating research in the emerging field of deep graph learning requires new tools. Such systems should support graph as the core abstraction and take care to maintain both forward (i.e. supporting new research ideas) and backward (i.e. integration with existing components) compatibility. In this paper, we present Deep Graph Library (DGL). DGL enables arbitrary message handling and mutation operators, flexible propagation rules, and is framework agnostic so as to leverage high-performance tensor, autograd operations, and other feature extraction modules already available in existing frameworks. DGL carefully handles the sparse and irregular graph structure, deals with graphs big and small which may change dynamically, fuses operations, and performs auto-batching, all to take advantages of modern hardware. DGL has been tested on a variety of models, including but not limited to the popular Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and its variants, with promising speed, memory footprint and scalability."
