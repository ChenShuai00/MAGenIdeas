    "abstract": "A Gram-positive, rod-shaped, motile, spore-forming bacterium, designated strain IB182496T, was isolated from coastal sand of the South China Sea. The strain grew optimally at pH 7.0-9.0, 20-30\u2009\u00b0C, and with NaCl 3.0-5.0\u200a%. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7 and the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15\u200a:\u200a0, iso-C16\u200a:\u200a0 and C16\u200a:\u200a0. The polar lipids in the cell wall included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three unidentified phospholipids and one unidentified lipid. The comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain IB182496T was most closely related to 'Paenibacillus sambharensis' SMB1 and Paenibacillus tarimensis SA-7-6T with similarities of 95.7 and 95.5\u2009%, respectively. The whole-genome average nucleotide identity values between strain IB182496T and the two reference strains were 70.8 and 70.5%, and the digital DNA-DNA hybridization values were 18.7 and 18.0\u200a%, respectively. Genomic analyses showed that strain IB182496T presented a genome of 6.22 Mbp with chromosomal G+C content of 60.3\u2009%, and a total of 5261 genes were predicted. The combined phylogenetic relatedness, phenotypic and genotypic features supported the conclusion that strain IB182496T should be considered as representing a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which we propose the name Paenibacillus sabuli sp. nov. with the type strain IB182496T (=MCCC 1K04627T=JCM 34216T)."
