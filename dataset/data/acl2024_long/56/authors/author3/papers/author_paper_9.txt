    "title": "ReflectionCoder: Learning from Reflection Sequence for Enhanced One-off Code Generation",
    "abstract": "Code generation plays a crucial role in various tasks, such as code auto-completion and mathematical reasoning. Previous work has proposed numerous methods to enhance code generation performance, including integrating feedback from the compiler. Inspired by this, we present ReflectionCoder, a novel approach that effectively leverages reflection sequences constructed by integrating compiler feedback to improve one-off code generation performance. Furthermore, we propose reflection self-distillation and dynamically masked distillation to effectively utilize these reflection sequences. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, i.e., HumanEval (+), MBPP (+), and MultiPl-E, demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our method achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, ReflectionCoder-DeepSeek-Coder-33B reaches pass@1 of 82.9 (76.8) on HumanEval (+) and 84.1 (72.0) on MBPP (+), on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-3-opus, and surpasses early GPT-4. Beyond the code domain, we believe this approach can benefit other domains that focus on final results and require long reasoning paths.
