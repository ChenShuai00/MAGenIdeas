    "title": "M3C: A Framework towards Convergent, Flexible, and Unsupervised Learning of Mixture Graph Matching and Clustering",
    "abstract": "Existing graph matching methods typically assume that there are similar structures between graphs and they are matchable. However, these assumptions do not align with real-world applications. This work addresses a more realistic scenario where graphs exhibit diverse modes, requiring graph grouping before or along with matching, a task termed mixture graph matching and clustering. We introduce Minorize-Maximization Matching and Clustering (M3C), a learning-free algorithm that guarantees theoretical convergence through the Minorize-Maximization framework and offers enhanced flexibility via relaxed clustering. Building on M3C, we develop UM3C, an unsupervised model that incorporates novel edge-wise affinity learning and pseudo label selection. Extensive experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph matching and mixture graph matching and clustering approaches in both accuracy and efficiency. Source code will be made publicly available."
