    "title": "TerDiT: Ternary Diffusion Models with Transformers",
    "abstract": "Recent developments in large-scale pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the generation of high-fidelity images, particularly with the emergence of diffusion models based on transformer architecture (DiTs). Among these diffusion models, diffusion transformers have demonstrated superior image generation capabilities, boosting lower FID scores and higher scalability. However, deploying large-scale DiT models can be expensive due to their extensive parameter numbers. Although existing research has explored efficient deployment techniques for diffusion models such as model quantization, there is still little work concerning DiT-based models. To tackle this research gap, in this paper, we propose TerDiT, a quantization-aware training (QAT) and efficient deployment scheme for ternary diffusion models with transformers. We focus on the ternarization of DiT networks and scale model sizes from 600M to 4.2B. Our work contributes to the exploration of efficient deployment strategies for large-scale DiT models, demonstrating the feasibility of training extremely low-bit diffusion transformer models from scratch while maintaining competitive image generation capacities compared to full-precision models. Code will be available at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/TerDiT."
