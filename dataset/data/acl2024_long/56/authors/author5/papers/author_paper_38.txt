    "title": "What Makes for Effective Few-shot Point Cloud Classification?",
    "abstract": "Due to the emergence of powerful computing resources and large-scale annotated datasets, deep learning has seen wide applications in our daily life. However, most current methods require extensive data collection and retraining when dealing with novel classes never seen before. On the other hand, we humans can quickly recognize new classes by looking at a few samples, which motivates the recent popularity of few-shot learning (FSL) in machine learning communities. Most current FSL approaches work on 2D image domain, however, its implication in 3D perception is relatively under-explored. Not only needs to recognize the unseen examples as in 2D domain, 3D few-shot learning is more challenging with unordered structures, high intra-class variances and subtle inter-class differences. Moreover, different architectures and learning algorithms make it difficult to study the effectiveness of existing 2D methods when migrating to the 3D domain.In this work, for the first time, we perform systematic and extensive studies of recent 2D FSL and 3D backbone networks for benchmarking few-shot point cloud classification, and we suggest a strong baseline and learning architectures for 3D FSL. Then, we propose a novel plug-and-play component called Cross-Instance Adaptation (CIA) module, to address the high intra-class variances and subtle inter-class differences issues, which can be easily inserted into current baselines with significant performance improvement. Extensive experiments on two newly introduced benchmark datasets, ModelNet40-FS and ShapeNet70-FS, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed network for 3D FSL."
