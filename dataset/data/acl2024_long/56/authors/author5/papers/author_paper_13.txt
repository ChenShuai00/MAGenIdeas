    "title": "UniMERNet: A Universal Network for Real-World Mathematical Expression Recognition",
    "abstract": "The paper introduces the UniMER dataset, marking the first study on Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) targeting complex real-world scenarios. The UniMER dataset includes a large-scale training set, UniMER-1M, which offers unprecedented scale and diversity with one million training instances to train high-quality, robust models. Additionally, UniMER features a meticulously designed, diverse test set, UniMER-Test, which covers a variety of formula distributions found in real-world scenarios, providing a more comprehensive and fair evaluation. To better utilize the UniMER dataset, the paper proposes a Universal Mathematical Expression Recognition Network (UniMERNet), tailored to the characteristics of formula recognition. UniMERNet consists of a carefully designed encoder that incorporates detail-aware and local context features, and an optimized decoder for accelerated performance. Extensive experiments conducted using the UniMER-1M dataset and UniMERNet demonstrate that training on the large-scale UniMER-1M dataset can produce a more generalizable formula recognition model, significantly outperforming all previous datasets. Furthermore, the introduction of UniMERNet enhances the model's performance in formula recognition, achieving higher accuracy and speeds.
