    "title": "Cross-Task Linearity Emerges in the Pretraining-Finetuning Paradigm",
    "abstract": "The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has become the prevailing trend in modern deep learning. In this work, we discover an intriguing linear phenomenon in models that are initialized from a common pretrained checkpoint and finetuned on different tasks, termed as Cross-Task Linearity (CTL) . Specifically, if we linearly interpolate the weights of two finetuned models, the features in the weight-interpolated model are approximately equal to the linear interpolation of features in two finetuned models at each layer. Such cross-task linearity has not been noted in peer literature. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence supporting that CTL consistently occurs for finetuned models that start from the same pretrained checkpoint. We conjecture that in the pretraining-finetuning paradigm, neural networks essentially function as linear maps, mapping from the parameter space to the feature space. Based on this viewpoint, our study unveils novel insights into explaining model merging/editing, particularly by translating operations from the parameter space to the feature space. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the underlying factors for the emergence of CTL, emphasizing the impact of pretraining."
