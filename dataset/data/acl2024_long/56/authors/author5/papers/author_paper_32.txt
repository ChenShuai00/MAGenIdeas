    "title": "Few-Shot Object Detection With Self-Adaptive Global Similarity and Two-Way Foreground Stimulator in Remote Sensing Images",
    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to localize and recognize potential objects of interest only by using a few annotated data, and it is beneficial for remote sensing images (RSIs) based applications, such as urban monitoring. Previous RSIs-based FSOD works often try to convert the support images from class-agnostic features to class-specific vectors, and then perform feature attention operations on query image features to be tested. However, such methods still face two critical challenges: 1) They ignore the spatial similarity of support-query features, which is indispensable for RSIs detection; 2) They perform the feature attention operation in a unidirectional manner, which means that the learned support-query relations are asymmetric. In this article, to address the challenges above, we design a few-shot object detector, which can quickly and accurately generalize to unseen categories with only a small amount of data. The proposed approach contains two components: 1) the self-adaptive global similarity module that preserves the internal context information to calculate the similarity map between the objects in support and query images, and 2) the two-way foreground stimulator module that can apply the similarity map to the detailed embeddings of support and query images at the same time to make full use of support information, further strengthening the foreground objects and weakening the unconcerned samples. Experiments are conducted on DIOR and NWPU VHR-10 datasets and their results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art methods."
