    "title": "Bacterial antigens and asthma: a comparative study of common respiratory pathogenic bacteria.",
    "abstract": "In a previous study we have shown that, in the presence of interleukin (IL)-33, repeated, per-nasal challenge of murine airways with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) organisms induces human asthma-like airways inflammation. It is not clear, however, whether this effect is unique or manifest in response to other common respiratory pathogens. To explore this, airways of BALB/c mice were repeatedly challenged per-nasally with formaldehyde-inactivated bacterial bodies in the presence or absence of murine recombinant IL-33. Serum concentrations of S.pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis (M.catarrhalis) and Haemophilus influenzae (H.influenzae) lysates-specific IgE were measured in patients with asthma and control subjects. We showed that in the presence of IL-33, repeated, per-nasal airways exposure to the bodies of these bacteria induced airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in the experimental mice. This was accompanied by cellular infiltration into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), eosinophilic infiltration and mucous hypertrophy of the lung tissue, with elevated local expression of some type 2 cytokines and elevated, specific IgG and IgE in the serum. The precise characteristics of the inflammation evoked by exposure to each bacterial species were distinguishable. These results suggest that in the certain circumstances, inhaled or commensal bacterial body antigens of both Gram-positive (S. pneumoniae) and Gram-negative (M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae) respiratory tract bacteria may initiate type 2 inflammation typical of asthma in the airways. In addition, we demonstrated that human asthmatic patients manifest elevated serum concentrations of M.catarrhalis- and H.influenzae-specific IgE."
