    "title": "AI4Bharat-IndicNLP Corpus: Monolingual Corpora and Word Embeddings for Indic Languages",
    "abstract": "We present the IndicNLP corpus, a large-scale, general-domain corpus containing 2.7 billion words for 10 Indian languages from two language families. We share pre-trained word embeddings trained on these corpora. We create news article category classification datasets for 9 languages to evaluate the embeddings. We show that the IndicNLP embeddings significantly outperform publicly available pre-trained embedding on multiple evaluation tasks. We hope that the availability of the corpus will accelerate Indic NLP research. The resources are available at this https URL."
