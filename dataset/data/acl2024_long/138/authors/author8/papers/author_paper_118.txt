    "abstract": "While discussing a concrete controversial topic, most humans will find it challenging to swiftly raise a diverse set of convincing and relevant claims that should set the basis of their arguments. Here, we demonstrate the initial capabilities of a system that, given a controversial topic, can automatically pinpoint relevant claims in Wikipedia, determine their polarity with respect to the given topic, and articulate them per the user's request."
