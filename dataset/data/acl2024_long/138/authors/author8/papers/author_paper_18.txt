    "title": "Vistaar: Diverse Benchmarks and Training Sets for Indian Language ASR",
    "abstract": "Improving ASR systems is necessary to make new LLM-based use-cases accessible to people across the globe. In this paper, we focus on Indian languages, and make the case that diverse benchmarks are required to evaluate and improve ASR systems for Indian languages. To address this, we collate Vistaar as a set of 59 benchmarks across various language and domain combinations, on which we evaluate 3 publicly available ASR systems and 2 commercial systems. We also train IndicWhisper models by fine-tuning the Whisper models on publicly available training datasets across 12 Indian languages totalling to 10.7K hours. We show that IndicWhisper significantly improves on considered ASR systems on the Vistaar benchmark. Indeed, IndicWhisper has the lowest WER in 39 out of the 59 benchmarks, with an average reduction of 4.1 WER. We open-source all datasets, code and models."
