    "title": "ELAICHI: Enhancing Low-resource TTS by Addressing Infrequent and Low-frequency Character Bigrams",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology have led to natural-sounding speech for English, primarily due to the availability of large-scale, high-quality web data. However, many other languages lack access to such resources, relying instead on limited studio-quality data. This scarcity results in synthesized speech that often suffers from intelligibility issues, particularly with low-frequency character bigrams. In this paper, we propose three solutions to address this challenge. First, we leverage high-quality data from linguistically or geographically related languages to improve TTS for the target language. Second, we utilize low-quality Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) data recorded in non-studio environments, which is refined using denoising and speech enhancement models. Third, we apply knowledge distillation from large-scale models using synthetic data to generate more robust outputs. Our experiments with Hindi demonstrate significant reductions in intelligibility issues, as validated by human evaluators. We propose this methodology as a viable alternative for languages with limited access to high-quality data, enabling them to collectively benefit from shared resources."
