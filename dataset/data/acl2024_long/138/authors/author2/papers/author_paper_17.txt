    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit cross-lingual topic 001 identi\ufb01cation (ID) in zero-shot settings by tak-002 ing a deeper dive into current datasets, base-003 line systems and the languages covered. We 004 identify shortcomings in the existing MLDoc 005 evaluation protocol and propose a robust al-006 ternative scheme, while also extending the 007 cross-lingual experimental setup to 17 lan-008 guages. We benchmark several systems that 009 are based on existing multilingual models such 010 as LASER, XLM-R, mUSE, and LaBSE on 011 the new evaluation protocol covering 17 lan-012 guages. Further, we present a novel Bayesian 013 multilingual document model (MBay) for 014 learning language-independent document em-015 beddings. The model learns to represent the 016 document embeddings in the form of Gaussian 017 distributions, thereby encoding the uncertainty 018 in its covariance. We propagate the learned un-019 certainties through linear classi\ufb01ers that bene-020 \ufb01t in zero-shot cross-lingual topic ID. Our ex-021 periments on 17 languages show that the pro-022 posed multilingual Bayesian document model 023 performs competitively as compared to other 024 systems based on LASER, XLM-R and mUSE 025 on 8 high resource languages, and outperforms 026 these systems on 9 mid-resource languages. Fi-027 nally, we consolidate the observations from all 028 our experiments, and discuss points that can 029 potentially bene\ufb01t the future research works in 030 the area of cross-lingual topic ID. 031"
