    "title": "Addressing Class Imbalance in Grammatical Error Detection with Evaluation Metric Optimization",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of class imbalance in supervised grammatical error detection (GED) for non-native speaker text, which is the result of the low proportion of erroneous examples compared to a large number of error-free examples. Most learning algorithms maximize accuracy which is not a suitable objective for such imbalanced data. For GED, most systems address this issue by tuning hyperparameters to maximize metrics like F\u03b2 . Instead, we show that learning classifiers that directly learn model parameters by optimizing evaluation metrics like F1 and F2 score deliver better performance on these metrics as compared to traditional sampling and cost-sensitive learning solutions for addressing class imbalance. Optimizing these metrics is useful in recall-oriented grammar error detection scenarios. We also show that there are inherent difficulties in optimizing precision-oriented evaluation metrics like F0.5. We establish this through a systematic evaluation on multiple datasets and different GED tasks."
