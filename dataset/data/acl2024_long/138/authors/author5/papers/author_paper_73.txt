    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe our submission to the ICON 2014 Tools Contest for Machine Translation. The source languages are English, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and the target language is Hindi. We submitted 15 systems; 5 each for the tourism, health and general domains. Our submission is a Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation system with preprocessing and post-processing elements. As preprocessing, we perform source-side reordering for English-Hindi translation, and source-side word segmentation for Indian language to Hindi translation. The translation outputs were post-edited by transliterating untranslated words. Our goal was to handle key divergences between the language pairs involved by using languageindependent methods which can be scaled across Indian languages without the need for expensive annotation creation. Hence, both the transliteration model and wordsegmenter have been learnt using unsupervised techniques, whereas our source reordering works for any target Indian language. Our approach results in a cumulative increase of BLEU scores in range of 3-6 compared to baseline phrase based SMT systems, with source side segmentation contributing to a major chunk of improvement. This demonstrates that resources created using unsupervised methods can significantly improve SMT performance involving Indian languages."
