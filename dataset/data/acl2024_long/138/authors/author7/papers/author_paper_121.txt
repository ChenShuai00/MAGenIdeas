    "title": "Augmenting Pivot based SMT with word segmentation",
    "abstract": "This paper is an attempt to bridge two well known performance degraders in SMT, viz. , (i) difference in morphological characteristics of the two languages, and (ii) scarcity of parallel corpora. We address these two problems using \u201cword segmen-tation\u201d and through \u201cpivots\u201d on the morphologically complex language. Our case study is Malayalam to Hindi SMT. Malay-alam belongs to the Dravidian family of languages and is heavily agglutinative. Hindi is a representative of the Indo-Aryan language family and is morphologically simpler. We use triangulation as pivoting strategy in combination with morphological pre-processing. We observe that (i) significant improvement in translation quality over direct SMT occurs when a pivot is used in combination with direct SMT, (ii) the more the number of pivots, the better the performance and (iii)word segmentation is a must. We achieved an improvement of 9.4 BLEU points which is over 58% compared to the baseline direct sys-tem. Our work paves way for SMT of languages that face resource scarcity and have widely divergent morphological characteristics."
