    "title": "Variable-length Neural Interlingua Representations for Zero-shot Neural Machine Translation",
    "abstract": "The language-independency of encoded representations within multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) models is crucial for their generalization ability on zero-shot translation. Neural interlingua representations have been shown as an effective method for achieving this. However, fixed-length neural interlingua representations introduced in previous work can limit its flexibility and representation ability. In this study, we introduce a novel method to enhance neural interlingua representations by making their length variable, thereby overcoming the constraint of fixed-length neural interlingua representations. Our empirical results on zero-shot translation on OPUS, IWSLT, and Europarl datasets demonstrate stable model convergence and superior zero-shot translation results compared to fixed-length neural interlingua representations. However, our analysis reveals the suboptimal efficacy of our approach in translating from certain source languages, wherein we pinpoint the defective model component in our proposed method."
