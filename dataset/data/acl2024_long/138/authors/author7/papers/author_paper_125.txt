    "title": "PaCMan : Parallel Corpus Management Workbench",
    "abstract": "We present a Parallel Corpora Management tool that aides parallel corpora generation for the task of Machine Translation (MT). It takes source and target text of a corpus for any language pair in text file format, or zip archives containing multiple corresponding text files. Then, it provides with a helpful interface to lexicographers for manual translation / validation, and gives out the corrected text files as output. It provides various dictionary references as help within the interface which increase the productivity and efficiency of a lexicographer. It also provides automatic translation of the source sentence using an integrated MT system. The tool interface includes a corpora management system which facilitates maintenance of parallel corpora by assigning roles such as manager, lexicographer etc. We have designed a novel tool that provides aides like references to various dictionary sources such as Wordnets, Shabdkosh, Wikitionary etc. We also provide manual word alignment correction which is visualized in the tool and can lead to its gamification in the future, thus, providing a valuable source of word / phrase alignments."
