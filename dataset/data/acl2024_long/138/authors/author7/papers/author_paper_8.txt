    "title": "Pralekha: An Indic Document Alignment Evaluation Benchmark",
    "abstract": "Mining parallel document pairs poses a significant challenge because existing sentence embedding models often have limited context windows, preventing them from effectively capturing document-level information. Another overlooked issue is the lack of concrete evaluation benchmarks comprising high-quality parallel document pairs for assessing document-level mining approaches, particularly for Indic languages. In this study, we introduce Pralekha, a large-scale benchmark for document-level alignment evaluation. Pralekha includes over 2 million documents, with a 1:2 ratio of unaligned to aligned pairs, covering 11 Indic languages and English. Using Pralekha, we evaluate various document-level mining approaches across three dimensions: the embedding models, the granularity levels, and the alignment algorithm. To address the challenge of aligning documents using sentence and chunk-level alignments, we propose a novel scoring method, Document Alignment Coefficient (DAC). DAC demonstrates substantial improvements over baseline pooling approaches, particularly in noisy scenarios, achieving average gains of 20-30% in precision and 15-20% in F1 score. These results highlight DAC's effectiveness in parallel document mining for Indic languages."
