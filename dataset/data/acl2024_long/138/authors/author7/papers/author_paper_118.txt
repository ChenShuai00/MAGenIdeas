    "abstract": "Pivot-based statistical machine translation (SMT) (Wu and Wang, 2007) has been shown a possible way of constructing a dictionary for the language pairs that have scarce parallel data (Tsunakawa et al., 2009). The assumption of this method is that there is a pair of large-scale parallel data: one between the source language and an intermediate resource rich language (henceforth called pivot), and one between that pivot and the target language. Once this assumption suffices, we can use the source-pivot and pivot-target parallel data to develop a source-target term1 translation model for dictionary construction. There are two main advantages of pivot-based SMT for dictionary construction. One is that because pivot-based SMT uses the log linear model as conventional phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2007) does, various features can be integrated to improve the accuracy. The other is that this method can address the data sparseness problem of directly merging the source-pivot and pivot-target terms, because it can use the portion of terms to generate new terms. However, the potential of this method has not been fully explored. Small-scale experiments in (Tsunakawa et al., 2009) showed very low accuracy of pivot-based SMT for dictionary construction.2 This paper presents our study to construct a largescale Japanese-Chinese (Ja-Zh) scientific dictionary, using large-scale Japanese-English (Ja-En) (49.1M sentences and 1.4M terms) and English-Chinese"
