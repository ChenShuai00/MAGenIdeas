    "title": "RomanSetu: Efficiently unlocking multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models models via Romanization",
    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to non-English languages, specifically those using non-Latin scripts. We propose an innovative approach that utilizes the romanized form of text as an interface for LLMs, hypothesizing that its frequent informal use and shared to-kens with English enhance cross-lingual alignment. Focusing on Hindi, we demonstrate through Hindi-to-English translation and sentiment analysis tasks that romanized text not only significantly improves inference efficiency due to its lower fertility compared to native text but also achieves competitive performance with limited pre-training. Additionally, our novel multi-script prompting approach, which combines romanized and native texts, shows promise in further enhancing task performance. These findings suggest the potential of roman-ization in bridging the language gap for LLM applications, with future work aimed at expanding this approach to more languages and tasks."
