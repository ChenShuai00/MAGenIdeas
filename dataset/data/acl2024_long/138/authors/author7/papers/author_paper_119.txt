    "title": "Large-scale Dictionary Construction via Pivot-based Statistical Machine Translation with Significance Pruning and Neural Network Features",
    "abstract": "We present our ongoing work on large-scale Japanese-Chinese bilingual dictionary construction via pivot-based statistical machine translation. We utilize statistical significance pruning to control noisy translation pairs that are induced by pivoting. We construct a large dictionary which we manually verify to be of a high quality. We then use this dictionary and a parallel corpus to learn bilingual neural network language models to obtain features for reranking the n-best list, which leads to an absolute improvement of 5% in accuracy when compared to a setting that does not use significance pruning and reranking."
