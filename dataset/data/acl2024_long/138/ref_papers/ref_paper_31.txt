    "title": "NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit",
    "abstract": "The Natural Language Toolkit is a suite of program modules, data sets and tutorials supporting research and teaching in computational linguistics and natural language processing. NLTK is written in Python and distributed under the GPL open source license. Over the past year the toolkit has been rewritten, simplifying many linguistic data structures and taking advantage of recent enhancements in the Python language. This paper reports on the simpli-\ufb01ed toolkit and explains how it is used in teaching NLP."
