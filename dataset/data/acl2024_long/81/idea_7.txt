    "Title": "TruthForest++: Multi-Scale Truthfulness Enhancement via Orthogonal Probes and Adaptive Editing",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the TruthForest method by introducing adaptive editing and multi-scale orthogonal probes. TruthForest++ creates multiple orthogonal bases for modeling truthfulness, each capturing different scales of truth-related features (e.g., word-level, sentence-level, and document-level). The framework uses a novel adaptive editing mechanism that dynamically selects the most relevant probe for a given input, enabling fine-grained control over truthfulness. Additionally, TruthForest++ incorporates a self-supervised training objective that encourages probes to capture complementary truth-related features. Experiments will demonstrate that TruthForest++ significantly improves truthfulness on benchmarks like TruthfulQA and outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.",
    "Thinking": "This idea builds on **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (Law 1), which emphasizes exploring theoretical boundaries. TruthForest’s use of orthogonal probes is a promising direction, but it does not fully exploit the multi-scale nature of truthfulness. By addressing this limitation, TruthForest++ offers a more comprehensive solution. The adaptive editing mechanism is inspired by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem solving** (Law 2), which involves creative problem-solving strategies. Finally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (Law 4) is applied to refine the probing and editing process, ensuring that the method is both effective and efficient.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for TruthForest++ lies in the multi-scale nature of truthfulness, as highlighted in papers like 'The Geometry of Truth' and 'Representation Engineering.' These works suggest that truthfulness is encoded at multiple levels of granularity, from individual words to entire documents. By capturing these scales, TruthForest++ can provide more precise control over LLM outputs. The adaptive editing mechanism also addresses the computational inefficiency of existing methods, making the framework more practical for real-world applications. This approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of LLM truthfulness enhancement."
