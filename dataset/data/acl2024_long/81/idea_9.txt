    "Title": "TruthGuard: Real-Time Hallucination Detection and Correction for LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces TruthGuard, a real-time system for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM outputs. TruthGuard combines a lightweight truthfulness classifier with an editing module that dynamically corrects false statements during generation. The classifier is trained using a novel contrastive learning objective that distinguishes between truthful and hallucinated outputs based on their internal representations. The editing module uses a causal intervention technique to steer the model toward truthful directions. TruthGuard is designed to be computationally efficient, enabling real-time deployment in applications like chatbots and virtual assistants. Experiments will demonstrate that TruthGuard significantly reduces hallucinations while maintaining high fluency and coherence.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Popper’s falsificationism** (Law 3), which emphasizes critically analyzing existing methods. The observation that current hallucination detection methods are either too slow or too inaccurate is addressed by proposing a lightweight and efficient solution. The contrastive learning objective is inspired by **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (Law 2), which involves creative leaps to formulate new hypotheses. Finally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (Law 4) is applied to refine the editing process, ensuring that the system is both effective and practical.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for TruthGuard lies in the growing demand for real-time hallucination detection and correction, particularly in high-stakes applications like healthcare and education. Papers like 'Inference-Time Intervention' and 'Alleviating Hallucinations of Large Language Models through Induced Hallucinations' highlight the importance of real-time solutions but do not address the computational challenges. By combining a lightweight classifier with an efficient editing module, TruthGuard provides a practical and scalable solution. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
