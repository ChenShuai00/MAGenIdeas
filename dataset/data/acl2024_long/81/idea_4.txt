    "Title": "TruthGuard: Real-Time Hallucination Detection and Mitigation for LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes TruthGuard, a real-time system for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. TruthGuard uses a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based approaches to identify potential hallucinations during inference. When a hallucination is detected, the system triggers a mitigation mechanism that either corrects the output or provides a warning to the user. TruthGuard also includes a feedback loop that allows the system to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. The framework is designed to be lightweight and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (Law 8) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (Law 4). Hansen’s theory is used to explore how anomalous findings (hallucinations) can be detected and mitigated in real-time, while Laudan’s model is applied to refine existing detection and mitigation techniques. The idea also draws on **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (Law 2) to hypothesize that a feedback loop can improve the system's performance over time.",
    "Rationale": "Real-time hallucination detection and mitigation is a critical challenge for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. TruthGuard addresses this challenge by providing a lightweight and scalable solution that can detect and mitigate hallucinations on the fly. The feedback loop is a novel contribution that enables the system to learn from its mistakes and improve over time, making it more effective and reliable. This approach has the potential to win best paper awards due to its practical impact and innovation."
