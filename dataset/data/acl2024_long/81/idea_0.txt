    "Title": "TruthFlow: Dynamic Truthfulness Control in LLMs via Multi-Layer Representation Editing",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic, multi-layer representation editing framework called TruthFlow, which extends TruthX by incorporating real-time feedback loops and multi-scale truthfulness control. TruthFlow identifies and edits truth-related features across multiple layers of a transformer model, rather than focusing on a single vector. It uses a combination of contrastive learning and reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the editing process during inference, ensuring that the model maintains high truthfulness across diverse contexts. The framework also introduces a 'truthfulness gradient' that quantifies the degree of truthfulness in each layer, enabling fine-grained control over the model's outputs. Experiments will demonstrate that TruthFlow outperforms TruthX and other baselines on benchmarks like TruthfulQA, while also reducing computational overhead.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (Law 4) and **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (Law 1). The methodological improvement model is used to refine TruthX by introducing dynamic, multi-layer editing, which addresses the limitation of editing a single vector. Kuhn’s paradigm theory is applied to identify the anomaly that truthfulness is not uniformly distributed across layers, suggesting a need for a multi-scale approach. The idea also leverages **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (Law 2) to hypothesize that a truthfulness gradient can improve control over model outputs.",
    "Rationale": "Current methods like TruthX focus on editing a single vector, which may not capture the full complexity of truthfulness in LLMs. By extending this to multi-layer editing and introducing dynamic feedback, TruthFlow can better align model outputs with factual accuracy. The truthfulness gradient provides a novel way to quantify and control truthfulness, making the framework both effective and interpretable. This approach has the potential to significantly advance the field by addressing a key limitation of existing methods and offering a scalable solution for real-world applications."
