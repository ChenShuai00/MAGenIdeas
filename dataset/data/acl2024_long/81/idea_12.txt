    "Title": "TruthX-Transfer: Transferable Truthfulness Editing Across LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a transfer learning framework for truthfulness editing, enabling the application of TruthX techniques across different LLMs without requiring model-specific fine-tuning. By leveraging a shared 'truthfulness embedding space,' TruthX-Transfer learns universal features of truthfulness that can be transferred to new models. The framework uses a meta-learning approach to adapt editing directions to the internal representations of target models, ensuring robust performance across architectures. Additionally, TruthX-Transfer introduces a 'transferability index' to measure the effectiveness of editing across models, providing a benchmark for cross-model truthfulness enhancement.",
    "Thinking": "This idea draws from **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** and **Quine’s holism**, which emphasize the importance of developing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks and balancing reductionism with emergence. The transfer learning approach is informed by **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which focuses on integrating new technologies and tools to improve existing methods. By creating a shared embedding space and using meta-learning, TruthX-Transfer addresses the challenge of applying truthfulness editing techniques to diverse LLMs, offering a scalable and generalizable solution.",
    "Rationale": "Current truthfulness editing methods, including TruthX, are often model-specific, limiting their applicability across different LLMs. TruthX-Transfer addresses this limitation by developing a transferable framework that can be applied to new models without extensive fine-tuning. The shared embedding space and meta-learning approach ensure robust performance across architectures, while the 'transferability index' provides a novel metric for evaluating cross-model editing. This approach has the potential to significantly broaden the impact of truthfulness editing techniques, making it a strong contender for best paper awards."
