    "Title": "TruthX++: Multi-Scale Truthfulness Enhancement via Hierarchical Latent Space Editing",
    "Idea": "Building on TruthX, this idea proposes a hierarchical latent space editing framework that operates at multiple scales of LLM representations (e.g., token-level, sentence-level, and discourse-level). By identifying and editing truthfulness-related features at each scale, TruthX++ aims to achieve more fine-grained control over LLM outputs. The framework integrates a multi-head contrastive learning mechanism to disentangle truthful and hallucinatory features across scales, enabling dynamic intervention during inference. Additionally, TruthX++ introduces a novel 'truthfulness gradient' metric to quantify the alignment of LLM outputs with ground truth, providing a more interpretable and actionable feedback loop for model editing.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** and **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which emphasize identifying anomalies and integrating interdisciplinary knowledge to discover new problems. The hierarchical approach addresses the limitation of TruthX, which operates primarily at a single scale of representation. By extending the editing framework to multiple scales, we can better capture the complexity of truthfulness in LLMs. The multi-head contrastive learning mechanism draws from **Carnap’s inductive logic** and **Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory**, which focus on abstracting general laws from multiple related studies. The 'truthfulness gradient' metric is informed by **Mayo’s experimental reasoning theory**, which emphasizes designing critical experiments to evaluate competing hypotheses.",
    "Rationale": "Current methods for enhancing LLM truthfulness, including TruthX, often focus on a single level of representation, which may not fully capture the multi-scale nature of truthfulness in language. By introducing a hierarchical framework, TruthX++ can address this gap, offering a more comprehensive solution. The multi-head contrastive learning mechanism ensures that truthful features are disentangled across scales, while the 'truthfulness gradient' provides a novel way to measure and improve truthfulness. This approach has the potential to significantly advance the field by offering a more robust and interpretable method for reducing hallucinations in LLMs."
