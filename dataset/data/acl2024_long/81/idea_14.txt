    "Title": "TruthX-Dynamic: Adaptive Truthfulness Editing via Reinforcement Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea extends TruthX by incorporating reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically adapt truthfulness editing during inference. The framework uses a reward signal based on the alignment of LLM outputs with ground truth to optimize editing directions in real-time. By integrating RL, TruthX-Dynamic can adapt to varying levels of hallucination and context, ensuring robust performance across different tasks and domains. Additionally, the framework introduces a 'dynamic truthfulness score' to quantify the effectiveness of adaptive editing, providing a novel metric for evaluating real-time truthfulness enhancement.",
    "Thinking": "This idea draws from **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem solving** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, which emphasize improving experimental design and control. The RL approach is informed by **Sutton’s model of scientific serendipity**, which focuses on exploring new explanatory frameworks and integrating multidisciplinary perspectives. By incorporating RL, TruthX-Dynamic addresses the challenge of adapting truthfulness editing to varying contexts, offering a more flexible and robust solution.",
    "Rationale": "Current truthfulness editing methods, including TruthX, operate statically during inference, limiting their ability to adapt to varying levels of hallucination and context. TruthX-Dynamic addresses this limitation by incorporating RL to dynamically optimize editing directions in real-time. The 'dynamic truthfulness score' provides a novel metric for evaluating real-time editing, making the framework more actionable and interpretable. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness and flexibility of truthfulness editing techniques, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
