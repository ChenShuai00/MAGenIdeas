    "abstract": "This paper describes QCRI\u2019s participation in SemEval-2015 Task 3 \u201cAnswer Selection in Community Question Answering\u201d, which targeted real-life Web forums, and was offered in both Arabic and English. We apply a supervised machine learning approach considering a manifold of features including among others word n-grams, text similarity, sentiment analysis, the presence of specific words, and the context of a comment. Our approach was the best performing one in the Arabic subtask and the third best in the two English subtasks."
