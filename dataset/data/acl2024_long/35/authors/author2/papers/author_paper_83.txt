    "abstract": "As the cybersecurity vulnerabilities in software 001 systems increase, so are the ways to exploit 002 them. Besides these, malware threats, irregu-003 lar network interactions and discussions about 004 exploits in public forums are also on the rise. 005 To identify these threats faster, to detect poten-006 tially relevant entities from any texts and to be 007 aware of software vulnerabilities, the need for 008 automated approaches becomes necessary. Ap-009 plication of natural language processing (NLP) 010 techniques in Cybersecurity domain can help in 011 achieving this. However, the diverse nature of 012 texts involved in cybersecurity domain, unavail-013 ability of large-scale publicly available datasets 014 and significant cost of hiring subject matter 015 experts for annotations demand the need of 016 building multi-task models that can be trained 017 jointly with limited data in this domain. In 018 this work, we introduce a generative multi-task 019 approach, U nified T ext-to-Text Cyber S ecurity 020 (UTS), trained on malware reports, phishing 021 site URLs, programming code constructs, so-022 cial media data, blogs, news articles and pub-023 lic forum posts. The experimental evaluations 024 show that the UTS approach with task-based 025 control codes has the potential to perform better 026 than training individually. 027"
