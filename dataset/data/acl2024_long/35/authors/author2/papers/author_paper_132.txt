    "title": "Remember What You have drawn: Semantic Image Manipulation with Memory",
    "abstract": "Image manipulation with natural language, which aims to manipulate images with the guidance of language descriptions, has been a challenging problem in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Currently, a number of efforts have been made for this task, but their performances are still distant away from generating realistic and text-conformed manipulated images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a memory-based Image Manipulation Network (MIM-Net), where a set of memories learned from images is introduced to synthesize the texture information with the guidance of the textual description. We propose a two-stage network with an additional reconstruction stage to learn the latent memories efficiently. To avoid the unnecessary background changes, we propose a Target Localization Unit (TLU) to focus on the manipulation of the region mentioned by the text. Moreover, to learn a robust memory, we further propose a novel randomized memory training loss. Experiments on the four popular datasets show the better performance of our method compared to the existing ones."
