    "abstract": "Previous studies have made great advances in 001 RST discourse parsing through neural frame-002 works or efficient features, but they split the 003 parsing process into two subtasks and heavily 004 depended on gold segmentation. In this pa-005 per, we introduce an end-to-end method for 006 sentence-level RST discourse parsing via trans-007 forming it into a text-to-text generation task. 008 Our method unifies the traditional two-stage 009 parsing and generates the parsing tree directly 010 from the input text without requiring a compli-011 cated model. Moreover, the EDU segmentation 012 can be simultaneously generated and extracted 013 from the parsing tree. Experimental results 014 on the RST Discourse Treebank demonstrate 015 that our proposed method outperforms existing 016 methods in both tasks of sentence-level RST 017 parsing and discourse segmentation. Consid-018 ering the lack of annotated data in RST pars-019 ing, we also create high-quality augmented data 020 based on several filtering strategies, which fur-021 ther improves the performance. 022"
