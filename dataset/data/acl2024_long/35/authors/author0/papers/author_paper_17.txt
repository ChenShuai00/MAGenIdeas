    "title": "MCCVA: A New Approach Using SVM and Kmeans for Load Balancing on Cloud",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, the demand of using resources, using services via the intranet system or on the Internet is rapidly growing. The respective problem coming is how to use these resources effectively in terms of time and quality. Therefore, the network QoS and its economy are people concerns, cloud computing was born in an inevitable trend. However, managing resources and scheduling tasks in virtualized data centres on the cloud are challenging tasks. Currently, there are a lot of Load Balancing algorithms applied in clouds and proposed by many authors, scholars, and experts. These existing methods are more about natural and heuristic, but the application of AI, or modern datamining technologies, in load balancing is not too popular due to the different characteristics of cloud. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to reduce the processing time (makespan) on cloud computing, helping the load balancing work more efficiency. Here, we use the SVM algorithm to classify the coming Requests, K - Mean to cluster the VMs in cloud, then the LB will allocate the requests into the VMs in the most reasonable way. In this way, request with the least processing time will be allocated to the VMs with the lowest usage. We name this new proposal as MCCVA - Makespan Classification & Clustering VM Algorithm. We have experimented and evaluated this algorithm in CloudSim, a cloud simulation environment, we obtained better results than some other well-known algorithms. With this MCCVA, we can see the big potential of AI and datamining in Load Balancing, we can further develop LB with AI to achieve better and better results of QoS."
