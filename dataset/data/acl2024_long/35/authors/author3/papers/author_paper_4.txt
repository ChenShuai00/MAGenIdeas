    "title": "Can-Do! A Dataset and Neuro-Symbolic Grounded Framework for Embodied Planning with Large Multimodal Models",
    "abstract": "Large multimodal models have demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities in vision and language tasks, and have the potential to encode extensive world knowledge. However, it remains an open challenge for these models to perceive, reason, plan, and act in realistic environments. In this work, we introduce Can-Do, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate embodied planning abilities through more diverse and complex scenarios than previous datasets. Our dataset includes 400 multimodal samples, each consisting of natural language user instructions, visual images depicting the environment, state changes, and corresponding action plans. The data encompasses diverse aspects of commonsense knowledge, physical understanding, and safety awareness. Our fine-grained analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4V, face bottlenecks in visual perception, comprehension, and reasoning abilities. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroGround, a neurosymbolic framework that first grounds the plan generation in the perceived environment states and then leverages symbolic planning engines to augment the model-generated plans. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared to strong baselines. Our code and dataset are available at https://embodied-planning.github.io."
