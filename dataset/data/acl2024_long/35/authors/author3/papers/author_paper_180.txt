    "title": "Robust detection of semi-structured web records using a DOM structure-knowledge-driven model",
    "abstract": "Web data record extraction aims at extracting a set of similar object records from a single webpage. These records have similar attributes or fields and are presented with a regular format in a coherent region of the page. To tackle this problem, most existing works analyze the DOM tree of an input page. One major limitation of these methods is that the lack of a global view in detecting data records from an input page results in a myopic decision. Their brute-force searching manner in detecting various types of records degrades the flexibility and robustness. We propose a Structure-Knowledge-Oriented Global Analysis (Skoga) framework which can perform robust detection of different-kinds of data records and record regions. The major component of the Skoga framework is a DOM structure-knowledge-driven detection model which can conduct a global analysis on the DOM structure to achieve effective detection. The DOM structure knowledge consists of background knowledge as well as statistical knowledge capturing different characteristics of data records and record regions, as exhibited in the DOM structure. The background knowledge encodes the semantics of labels indicating general constituents of data records and regions. The statistical knowledge is represented by some carefully designed features that capture different characteristics of a single node or a node group in the DOM. The feature weights are determined using a development dataset via a parameter estimation algorithm based on a structured output support vector machine. An optimization method based on the divide-and-conquer principle is developed making use of the DOM structure knowledge to quantitatively infer and recognize appropriate records and regions for a page. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves higher accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods."
