    "Title": "Linguistically-Diverse Prompt Engineering for Zero-Shot Multilingual Tasks",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of linguistically diverse prompts to improve zero-shot performance in multilingual tasks. The approach involves creating a diverse set of prompts that incorporate linguistic features from multiple high-resource languages, which are then used to guide LLMs in performing tasks in low-resource languages. The prompts would be designed to capture syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features of the target languages, enabling the model to generalize better across languages. This method could be applied to tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering, improving the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs for low-resource languages.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Laudan’s methodological improvement model and Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory. The target paper already proposes a method for unsupervised prompting, and this idea builds on that by improving the design of prompts. By analyzing multiple related studies, we can identify common patterns in prompt engineering and construct a framework that generalizes across languages. This approach is innovative because it leverages linguistic diversity to improve zero-shot performance, which is a significant challenge in multilingual NLP.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that zero-shot performance in low-resource languages is often limited by the lack of linguistic diversity in prompts. By creating linguistically diverse prompts, we can improve the model's ability to generalize across languages, making it more effective in zero-shot settings. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of LLMs in low-resource languages, making them more accessible and useful for a wider range of tasks."
