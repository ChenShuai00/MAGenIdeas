    "Title": "Dynamic Multilingual Prompting with Reinforcement Learning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic multilingual prompting. The model learns to select the most effective prompts for a given task and language pair by receiving feedback on its performance. The RL framework allows the model to adapt its prompting strategy in real-time, improving its ability to handle low-resource languages. The approach involves training the model on a diverse set of tasks and languages, with the goal of maximizing translation quality and task performance across all languages.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Laudan’s methodological improvement model and Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions. The target paper uses static prompts, which may not be optimal for all languages or tasks. By introducing a dynamic prompting strategy, we can address this limitation and propose a paradigm shift in how multilingual models are trained. This idea also builds on referenced papers like 'Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback,' which demonstrates the effectiveness of RL in improving model performance.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that static prompts are inherently limited in their ability to handle the diversity of languages and tasks. By using RL to dynamically adjust the prompting strategy, we can improve the model's adaptability and performance across a wide range of scenarios. This approach has the potential to set a new standard for multilingual models, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
