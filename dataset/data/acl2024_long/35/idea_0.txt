    "Title": "Cultural Context-Aware Multilingual Prompting for Low-Resource Languages",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel approach to multilingual prompting that incorporates cultural context into the prompt design. By leveraging cultural and linguistic similarities between languages, the model can generate more accurate and culturally relevant translations and summaries for low-resource languages. The approach involves creating a cultural context database that maps linguistic features to cultural norms and integrating this database into the prompting process. This method not only improves translation quality but also ensures that the outputs are culturally appropriate, which is critical for applications like education, healthcare, and legal services.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s paradigm theory and Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method. The target paper highlights the challenge of low-resource languages but does not address the role of cultural context. By identifying this gap, I propose a new problem: how to incorporate cultural context into multilingual prompting. The hypothesis is that cultural context can improve cross-lingual transfer, especially for languages with similar cultural backgrounds. This idea also builds on the referenced papers, such as 'No Language Left Behind,' which emphasizes the importance of cultural considerations in machine translation.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that current multilingual models often fail to account for cultural nuances, leading to translations that are technically correct but culturally inappropriate. By integrating cultural context into the prompting process, we can improve both the accuracy and relevance of translations for low-resource languages. This approach has the potential to significantly impact fields like education and healthcare, where cultural sensitivity is crucial."
