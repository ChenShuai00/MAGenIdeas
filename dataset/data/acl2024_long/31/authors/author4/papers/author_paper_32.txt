    "abstract": "Multimodal named entity recognition and re-001 lation extraction (MNER and MRE) is a fun-002 damental and crucial branch in multimodal 003 learning. However, existing approaches for 004 MNER and MRE mainly suffer from 1) er-005 ror sensitivity when images contain irrele-006 vant concepts not mentioned in texts; and 007 2) large modality gap between image and 008 text features, especially hierarchical visual fea-009 tures. To deal with these issues, we propose a 010 novel H ierarchical M odality fusion NeT work 011 ( HMNeT ) for visual-enhanced entity and rela-012 tion extraction, aim to reduce the modality gap 013 and achieve more effective and robust perfor-014 mance. Speci\ufb01cally, we innovatively leverage 015 hierarchical pyramidal visual features to con-016 duct multi-layer internal integration in Trans-017 former. We further present a dynamic gated 018 aggregation strategy to decide modality inte-019 gration according to different images. Exten-020 sive experiments on three benchmark datasets 021 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, 022 and achieve state-of-the-art performance 1 . 023"
