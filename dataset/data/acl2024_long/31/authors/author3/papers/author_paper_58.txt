    "title": "DGMED: A Novel Document-Level Graph Convolution Network for Multi-Event Detection",
    "abstract": "Online news documents can contain thousands 001 of characters and tens of events. To detect 002 events in these documents, it is important to 003 construct long-range context information. Such 004 information, however, is not effectively cre-005 ated in existing event detection methods in-006 cluding DMBERT, MOGANED. As a result, 007 these methods show poor event detection accu-008 racy in production where long documents are 009 common. To address this, this paper proposes 010 a Document-level Graph convolution network 011 for Multi-event Detection (DGMED). DGMED 012 represents each sentence in a long document as 013 a graph, and it interconnects these graphs us-014 ing novel cross-sentence global neural network 015 nodes. These nodes allow DGMED further 016 construct accurate document-level contextual 017 information, thus accurately extracting multi-018 ple events as required. We evaluate DGMED 019 using a public event extraction dataset (i.e., 020 Maven) and a production large-scale dataset 021 (named AML). Evaluation results show that 022 DGMED can out-perform state-of-the-art meth-023 ods BERT+CRF and BiLSTM+CRF up to 0.7% 024 in Maven and 5.7% in AML. 025"
