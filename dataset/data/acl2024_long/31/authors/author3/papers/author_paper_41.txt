    "abstract": "Business Knowledge Graph is important to many enterprises today, providing the factual knowledge and structured data that steer many products and make them more intelligent. Despite the welcome outcome, building business KG brings prohibitive issues of de\ufb01cient structure, multiple modalities and unmanage-able quality. In this paper, we advance the practical challenges related to building KG in non-trivial real-world systems. We introduce the process of building an open business knowledge graph (OpenBG) derived from a well-known enterprise. Speci\ufb01cally, we de-\ufb01ne a core ontology to cover various abstract products and consumption demands, with \ufb01ne-grained taxonomy and multi-modal facts in deployed applications. OpenBG is ongoing, and the current version contains more than 2.6 billion triples with more than 88 million entities and 2,681 types of relations. We release all the open resources (OpenBG benchmark) derived from it for the community. We also report benchmark results with best learned lessons 1 ."
