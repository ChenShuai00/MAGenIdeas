    "title": "Construction and Applications of Billion-Scale Pre-Trained Multimodal Business Knowledge Graph",
    "abstract": "Business Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are important to many enterprises today, providing factual knowledge and structured data that steer many products and make them more intelligent. Despite their promising benefits, building business KG necessitates solving prohibitive issues of deficient structure and multiple modalities. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the practical challenges related to building KG in non-trivial real-world systems. We introduce the process of building an open business knowledge graph (OpenBG) derived from a well-known enterprise, Alibaba Group. Specifically, we define a core ontology to cover various abstract products and consumption demands, with fine-grained taxonomy and multimodal facts in deployed applications. OpenBG is an open business KG of unprecedented scale: 2.6 billion triples with more than 88 million entities covering over 1 million core classes/concepts and 2,681 types of relations. We release all the open resources (OpenBG benchmarks) derived from it for the community and report experimental results of KG-centric tasks. We also run up an online competition based on OpenBG benchmarks, and has attracted thousands of teams. We further pre-train OpenBG and apply it to many KG-enhanced downstream tasks in business scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of billion-scale multimodal knowledge for e-commerce. All the resources with codes have been released at https://github.com/OpenBGBenchmark/OpenBG."
