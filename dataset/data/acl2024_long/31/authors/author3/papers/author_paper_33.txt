    "title": "Schema-aware Reference as Prompt Improves Data-Efficient Relational Triple and Event Extraction",
    "abstract": "Information Extraction, which aims to extract structural relational triple or event from unstructured texts, often suffers from data scarcity issues. With the development of pre-trained language models, many prompt-based approaches to data-efficient information extraction have been proposed and achieved impressive performance. However, existing prompt learning methods for information extraction are still susceptible to several potential limitations: (i) semantic gap between natural language and output structure knowledge with pre-defined schema; (ii) representation learning with locally individual instances limits the performance given the insufficient features. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of schema-aware R eference A s P rompt ( RAP ), which dynamically leverage schema and knowledge inherited from global (few-shot) training data for each sample. Specifically, we propose a schema-aware reference store , which unifies symbolic schema and relevant textual instances. Then, we employ a dynamic reference integration module to retrieve pertinent knowledge from the datastore as prompts during training and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that RAP can be plugged into various existing models and outperforms baselines in low-resource settings on four datasets of relational triple extraction and event extraction. In addition, we provide comprehensive empirical ablations and case analysis regarding different types and scales of knowledge in order to better understand the mechanisms of RAP 1 ."
