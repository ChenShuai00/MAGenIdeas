    "title": "Addressing Entity Bias Transfer: A Large Causality Extraction Dataset from Health Literature",
    "abstract": "Extracting causality from text has become an 001 important task in the field of Natural Language 002 Processing (NLP). However, it faces two main 003 challenges. Firstly, existing causality extrac-004 tion datasets are primarily based on general 005 text structures, while a significant amount of 006 causal knowledge exists in scientific literature 007 with more complex sentence structures. Sec-008 ondly, due to the unbalanced distribution of 009 labels in the dataset, there are spurious as-010 sociations between entities and labels, which 011 leads to the possibility of the model making 012 causal judgments by biasing specific entity 013 pairs, thereby increasing the model\u2019s accu-014 racy. To address these two challenges, this 015 paper introduces a large causality extraction 016 dataset called CauDEBT, comprising 25,268 in-017 stances obtained from health domain literature 018 abstracts. This dataset employs the entity pair 019 non-overlapping division to prevent the transfer 020 of biases learned from the training set to the test 021 set, ensuring a fair evaluation of generalization 022 ability. Additionally, this paper presents two 023 entity debias strategies from entity representa-024 tion construction and counterfactual reasoning 025 perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate 026 the effectiveness of these two strategies in mit-027 igating entity bias and enhancing the model\u2019s 028 generalization ability on our CauDEBT dataset 029 and the SemEval dataset. 030"
