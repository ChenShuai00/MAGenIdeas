    "Title": "Multi-Modal Pre-Instruction-Tuning for Enhanced Knowledge Representation",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-modal pre-instruction-tuning framework that integrates text, images, and other modalities into the pre-instruction-tuning process. The framework uses a combination of multi-modal encoders and retrieval-augmented generation to expose LLMs to diverse forms of knowledge during pre-instruction-tuning. This approach enables LLMs to learn more robust and versatile knowledge representations, which can be applied to tasks such as visual QA, multi-modal summarization, and cross-modal retrieval. The framework could be particularly useful in domains like education, healthcare, and entertainment, where multi-modal knowledge is essential.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhnâ€™s paradigm theory, which emphasizes integrating interdisciplinary knowledge. The target paper highlights the limitations of LLMs in encoding knowledge from complex documents, while referenced papers like 'BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension' and 'REPLUG: Retrieval-Augmented Black-Box Language Models' suggest that multi-modal and retrieval-augmented approaches can enhance knowledge representation. By integrating multi-modal encoders and retrieval-augmented generation into pre-instruction-tuning, this idea pushes the boundaries of how LLMs learn and represent knowledge, creating a novel framework that could redefine the capabilities of LLMs in multi-modal tasks.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the need for LLMs to handle diverse forms of knowledge. Current pre-instruction-tuning methods focus primarily on text, limiting the model's ability to represent multi-modal knowledge. By incorporating multi-modal encoders and retrieval-augmented generation, this framework enables LLMs to learn more robust and versatile knowledge representations. This could have a transformative impact on applications that require multi-modal knowledge, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award."
