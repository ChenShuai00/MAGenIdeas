    "Title": "Explainable Knowledge Retrieval via Attention Visualization",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework for explainable knowledge retrieval in LLMs, using attention visualization to highlight the most relevant parts of retrieved documents. The model would be trained to generate attention maps that indicate which parts of the document were most influential in answering a given question. These attention maps would provide insights into the model’s reasoning process, improving its interpretability and trustworthiness.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by Kuhn’s paradigm theory, which emphasizes the importance of re-examining existing methods and exploring new paradigms. The hypothesis is that attention visualization can provide a more transparent and interpretable approach to knowledge retrieval, addressing the black-box nature of current LLMs. This aligns with the target paper’s focus on improving knowledge encoding and retrieval.",
    "Rationale": "Explainability is a major challenge for LLMs, as their reasoning processes are often opaque. Attention visualization provides a way to make these processes more transparent, improving user trust and enabling better debugging. This approach is particularly relevant for high-stakes applications, such as healthcare or finance, where interpretability is critical."
