    "Title": "Instruction-Tuning with Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Lifelong Learning in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a novel instruction-tuning framework that incorporates a retrieval-augmented memory (RAM) module. The RAM module would allow the LLM to store and retrieve factual knowledge during both training and inference, enabling the model to continuously update its knowledge base without catastrophic forgetting. The framework would involve two stages: (1) pre-instruction-tuning with QA pairs, where the model learns to associate questions with relevant knowledge stored in the RAM, and (2) continued pre-training on documents, where the model encodes new knowledge into the RAM. The RAM module would be implemented using a differentiable memory architecture, allowing the model to learn how to store and retrieve information efficiently. This approach would enable LLMs to perform lifelong learning, adapting to new information over time while retaining previously learned knowledge.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. The current approach to instruction-tuning is limited by its inability to handle evolving knowledge. By introducing a retrieval-augmented memory module, we can address this limitation and create a more robust training paradigm. The idea also aligns with **Quine’s holism**, as it integrates memory retrieval into the training process, creating a unified framework for knowledge storage and retrieval. The focus on lifelong learning is derived from **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, as it hypothesizes that continuous knowledge updating will lead to better model performance over time.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the need for LLMs to adapt to evolving information without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Current models struggle with catastrophic forgetting, which limits their ability to perform lifelong learning. By incorporating a retrieval-augmented memory module, the model can continuously update its knowledge base, making it more effective in real-world applications where information is constantly changing. This approach has the potential to revolutionize how LLMs are trained and deployed, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
