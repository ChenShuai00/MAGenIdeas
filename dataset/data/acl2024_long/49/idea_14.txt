    "Title": "Self-Supervised Instruction-Tuning for Unsupervised Knowledge Acquisition in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a self-supervised instruction-tuning framework that enables LLMs to acquire knowledge without explicit supervision. The framework would involve training the model to generate its own QA pairs from unlabeled text, which would then be used for instruction-tuning. The model would learn to identify key facts and relationships in the text and generate relevant questions and answers. This approach would allow the model to continuously learn from new data without requiring human-labeled QA pairs, making it more scalable and adaptable to evolving information. The framework would also incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to allow the model to access external knowledge sources during training and inference.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. The current approach to instruction-tuning relies heavily on human-labeled data, which limits its scalability and adaptability. By introducing a self-supervised training process, we can address this limitation and create a more scalable and flexible training paradigm. The idea also aligns with **Quine’s holism**, as it integrates unsupervised learning with instruction-tuning. The focus on self-supervision is derived from **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, as it hypothesizes that generating QA pairs from unlabeled text will lead to better knowledge acquisition.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the need for LLMs to continuously learn from new data without requiring extensive human supervision. By enabling the model to generate its own QA pairs, we can create a more scalable and adaptable training process that can handle evolving information. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the scalability and effectiveness of LLMs, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
