    "Title": "Hierarchical Instruction-Tuning for Multi-Level Knowledge Encoding in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hierarchical instruction-tuning framework that enables LLMs to encode knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction. The framework would involve training the model in a hierarchical manner, starting with high-level concepts and gradually moving to more detailed factual knowledge. For example, the model would first learn to associate broad categories (e.g., 'science') with relevant subcategories (e.g., 'physics'), and then learn specific facts (e.g., 'E=mc^2'). This approach would allow the model to better organize and retrieve knowledge, improving its performance on complex tasks that require multi-level reasoning. The framework would also incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to allow the model to access external knowledge sources during training and inference.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. The current approach to instruction-tuning treats all knowledge as equally important, which limits the model's ability to reason at different levels of abstraction. By introducing a hierarchical training process, we can address this limitation and create a more robust knowledge encoding framework. The idea also aligns with **Quine’s holism**, as it integrates multiple levels of knowledge into a unified framework. The focus on hierarchical learning is derived from **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method**, as it hypothesizes that organizing knowledge hierarchically will lead to better reasoning abilities.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is based on the need for LLMs to reason at multiple levels of abstraction, especially in complex tasks that require both broad conceptual understanding and detailed factual knowledge. By organizing knowledge hierarchically, the model can better encode and retrieve information, improving its performance on a wide range of tasks. This approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of LLM training, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards."
