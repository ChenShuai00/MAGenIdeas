    "title": "Supervised Search Result Diversification via Subtopic Attention",
    "abstract": "Search result diversification aims to retrieve diverse results to satisfy as many different information needs as possible. Supervised methods have been proposed recently to learn ranking functions and they have been shown to produce superior results to unsupervised methods. However, these methods use implicit approaches based on the principle of Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR). In this paper, we propose a learning framework for explicit result diversification where subtopics are explicitly modeled. Based on the information contained in the sequence of selected documents, we use the attention mechanism to capture the subtopics to be focused on while selecting the next document, which naturally fits our task of document selection for diversification. As a preliminary attempt, we employ recurrent neural networks and max pooling to instantiate the framework. We use both distributed representations and traditional relevance features to model documents in the implementation. The framework is flexible to model query intent in either a flat list or a hierarchy. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms all the existing search result diversification approaches."
