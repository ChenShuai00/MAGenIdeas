    "title": "Automatically Mining Facets for Queries from Their Search Results",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of finding query facets which are multiple groups of words or phrases that explain and summarize the content covered by a query. We assume that the important aspects of a query are usually presented and repeated in the query\u2019s top retrieved documents in the style of lists, and query facets can be mined out by aggregating these significant lists. We propose a systematic solution, which we refer to as QDMiner, to automatically mine query facets by extracting and grouping frequent lists from free text, HTML tags, and repeat regions within top search results. Experimental results show that a large number of lists do exist and useful query facets can be mined by QDMiner. We further analyze the problem of list duplication, and find better query facets can be mined by modeling fine-grained similarities between lists and penalizing the duplicated lists."
