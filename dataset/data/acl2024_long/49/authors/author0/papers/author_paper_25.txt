    "title": "Semi-supervised Open Domain Information Extraction with Conditional VAE",
    "abstract": "Open information extraction (OpenIE) is the task of extracting open-domain assertions from natural language sentences. However, the lack of annotated data hurts the performance of current model and made it barely satisfactory. In this paper, we aim to improve the OpenIE model with the help of the semantic role labeling (SRL) data, which has a very similar goal of identifying predicateargument structure from natural language sentences, but with more labeled instances available. We propose a semi-supervised OpenIE model, which jointly optimizes supervised loss and unsupervised loss by treating OpenIE labels as hidden variables to reconstruct observed SRL labels. Conditional variantional autoencoder (CVAE) is used to optimize the lower bound of the data loglikelihood. Different from traditional multitask or transfer learning, we apply a more direct way to exploit the correlation between OpenIE and SRL. We compare our model with transfer and multitask learning, and the results corroborate that our framework is able to better utilize such correlation information."
