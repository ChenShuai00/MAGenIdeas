    "title": "Dynamic Structural Role Node Embedding for User Modeling in Evolving Networks",
    "abstract": "Complex user behavior, especially in settings such as social media, can be organized as time-evolving networks. Through network embedding, we can extract general-purpose vector representations of these dynamic networks which allow us to analyze them without extensive feature engineering. Prior work has shown how to generate network embeddings while preserving the structural role proximity of nodes. These methods, however, cannot capture the temporal evolution of the structural identity of the nodes in dynamic networks. Other works, on the other hand, have focused on learning microscopic dynamic embeddings. Though these methods can learn node representations over dynamic networks, these representations capture the local context of nodes and do not learn the structural roles of nodes. In this article, we propose a novel method for learning structural node embeddings in discrete-time dynamic networks. Our method, called HR2vec, tracks historical topology information in dynamic networks to learn dynamic structural role embeddings. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world temporal datasets, we show that our method outperforms other well-known methods in tasks where structural equivalence and historical information both play important roles. HR2vec can be used to model dynamic user behavior in any networked setting where users can be represented as nodes. Additionally, we propose a novel method (called network fingerprinting) that uses HR2vec embeddings for modeling whole (or partial) time-evolving networks. We showcase our network fingerprinting method on synthetic and real-world networks. Specifically, we demonstrate how our method can be used for detecting foreign-backed information operations on Twitter."
