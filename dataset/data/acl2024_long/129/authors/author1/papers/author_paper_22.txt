    "title": "A Transformer-based Framework for Neutralizing and Reversing the Political Polarity of News Articles",
    "abstract": "People often prefer to consume news with similar political predispositions and access like-minded news articles, which aggravates polarized clusters known as \"echo chamber\". To mitigate this phenomenon, we propose a computer-aided solution to help combat extreme political polarization. Specifically, we present a framework for reversing or neutralizing the political polarity of news headlines and articles. The framework leverages the attention mechanism of a Transformer-based language model to first identify polar sentences, and then either flip the polarity to the neutral or to the opposite through a GAN network. Tested on the same benchmark dataset, our framework achieves a 3%-10% improvement on the flipping/neutralizing success rate of headlines compared with the current state-of-the-art model. Adding to prior literature, our framework not only flips the polarity of headlines but also extends the task of polarity flipping to full-length articles. Human evaluation results show that our model successfully neutralizes or reverses the polarity of news without reducing readability. We release a large annotated dataset that includes both news headlines and full-length articles with polarity labels and meta-data to be used for future research. Our framework has a potential to be used by social scientists, content creators and content consumers in the real world."
