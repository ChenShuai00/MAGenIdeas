    "title": "Towards Improved Model Design for Authorship Identification: A Survey on Writing Style Understanding",
    "abstract": "Authorship identification tasks, which rely heavily on linguistic styles, have always been an important part of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) research. While other tasks based on linguistic style understanding benefit from deep learning methods, these methods have not behaved as well as traditional machine learning methods in many authorship-based tasks. With these tasks becoming more and more challenging, however, traditional machine learning methods based on handcrafted feature sets are already approaching their performance limits. Thus, in order to inspire future applications of deep learning methods in authorship-based tasks in ways that benefit the extraction of stylistic features, we survey authorship-based tasks and other tasks related to writing style understanding. We first describe our survey results on the current state of research in both sets of tasks and summarize existing achievements and problems in authorship-related tasks. We then describe outstanding methods in style-related tasks in general and analyze how they are used in combination in the top-performing models. We are optimistic about the applicability of these models to authorship-based tasks and hope our survey will help advance research in this field."
