    "Title": "Explainable Error-Driven Reasoning: Bridging the Gap Between Errors and Explanations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework that not only corrects reasoning errors but also generates natural language explanations for why the errors occurred and how they were corrected. The framework integrates an 'explanation generator' that uses the model's internal reasoning pathways to produce detailed, human-readable explanations. These explanations are then used to fine-tune the model, creating a feedback loop that improves both reasoning accuracy and explainability. The framework is trained using a combination of supervised learning (on annotated error-explanation datasets) and reinforcement learning (to optimize the quality of explanations). The system also includes a 'user feedback' module that allows human users to provide additional corrections and explanations, further enhancing the model's learning process.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**. Hansen’s theory emphasizes the importance of explaining anomalies, which aligns with the framework's focus on generating explanations for errors. Laudan’s model highlights the importance of methodological refinement, which is reflected in the feedback loop that improves both reasoning accuracy and explainability. The 'user feedback' module draws from **Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions**, as it allows for iterative improvements based on human input. The reinforcement learning component is influenced by **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**, as it optimizes the quality of explanations through iterative refinement. Finally, the focus on explainability aligns with **Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory**, which emphasizes the importance of generating meaningful explanations from data.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs often lack explainability, making it difficult to understand why they make certain errors and how they can be corrected. By introducing a framework that generates natural language explanations for errors, this idea addresses a critical limitation in LLM reasoning. The feedback loop ensures that the model not only corrects errors but also learns from them, leading to more robust and interpretable reasoning. The inclusion of a 'user feedback' module allows for continuous improvement based on human input, further enhancing the model's performance. This approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of AI reasoning, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences.",
