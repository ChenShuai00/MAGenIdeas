    "Title": "Collaborative Error-Correction: A Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Enhancing LLM Reasoning",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a human-in-the-loop framework called Collaborative Error-Correction (CEC), which enhances LLM reasoning by integrating human feedback into the error-correction process. CEC involves a two-step process: (1) the model generates a reasoning chain and identifies potential errors, and (2) human annotators review the identified errors and provide corrections. The model then fine-tunes itself based on the human feedback, improving its error-correction capabilities over time. The framework also includes a feedback prioritization mechanism that focuses human attention on the most critical errors, maximizing the efficiency of the human-in-the-loop process. By combining human expertise with machine learning, CEC significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of LLM reasoning.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (integrating human feedback to explain and correct errors) and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (proposing a new hypothesis for collaborative error correction). The focus on human-in-the-loop learning aligns with **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**, which emphasizes the importance of combining human and machine intelligence. The feedback prioritization mechanism is rooted in **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, as it refines the error-correction process through iterative improvement.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs lack mechanisms to effectively integrate human feedback into the error-correction process, limiting their accuracy and reliability. By introducing collaborative error-correction, CEC addresses this limitation, making LLMs more robust and trustworthy. This idea has the potential to significantly advance the field of human-in-the-loop AI, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
