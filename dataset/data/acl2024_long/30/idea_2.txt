    "Title": "Explainable Error-Driven Learning: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Human-Interpretable Error Explanations",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a framework called Explainable Error-Driven Learning (XEDL), which enhances LLM reasoning by providing human-interpretable explanations for errors. XEDL integrates an explanation generation module that produces natural language descriptions of why a reasoning step is incorrect and how it can be corrected. These explanations are used to fine-tune the model, enabling it to avoid similar errors in the future. The framework also includes a user interface that allows human annotators to provide feedback on the generated explanations, further improving the model's error-correction capabilities. By combining error-driven learning with explainability, XEDL not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes LLMs more transparent and trustworthy.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings** (explaining and integrating errors) and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (proposing a new hypothesis for explainable error-driven learning). The focus on human-interpretable explanations aligns with **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving**, which emphasizes the importance of transparent reasoning processes. The integration of human feedback is rooted in **Laudan’s methodological improvement model**, as it refines the model's error-correction capabilities through iterative improvement.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLMs lack mechanisms to provide human-interpretable explanations for errors, limiting their transparency and trustworthiness. By introducing explainable error-driven learning, XEDL addresses this limitation, making LLMs more reliable and easier to debug. This idea has the potential to significantly advance the field of explainable AI, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards.",
