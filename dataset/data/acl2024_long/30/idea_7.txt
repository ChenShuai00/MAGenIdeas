    "Title": "Cross-Domain Error Transfer: Leveraging Errors from One Domain to Improve Reasoning in Another",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the concept of cross-domain error transfer, where errors made by LLMs in one domain (e.g., mathematical reasoning) are used to improve reasoning in another domain (e.g., commonsense reasoning). The framework involves identifying common error patterns across domains and using them to create a shared error correction module that can be applied to multiple tasks. The module is trained using a combination of domain-specific and cross-domain error data, allowing it to generalize across different types of reasoning tasks. The goal is to create a more versatile and robust LLM that can learn from its mistakes across a wide range of domains.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** (from Law 5: Abstract and Summarize General Laws), which emphasizes the importance of identifying common patterns across different studies. By identifying common error patterns across domains, we can create a shared error correction module that improves reasoning in multiple domains. Additionally, **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** (from Law 6: Construct and Modify Theoretical Models) is used to develop a unified framework for error correction that can be applied across different domains. The integration of cross-domain data is inspired by **Glaser and Strauss’s grounded theory** (from Law 5), which emphasizes the importance of iterative data analysis in theory development.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLM error correction methods are often domain-specific, which limits their ability to generalize across different types of reasoning tasks. By introducing a cross-domain error transfer framework, we can create a more versatile and robust LLM that can learn from its mistakes across a wide range of domains. This approach is novel because it leverages errors from one domain to improve reasoning in another, which has not been explored in the context of LLMs. The potential impact is significant, as it could lead to more generalizable and robust LLMs that can handle a wide range of reasoning tasks with fewer errors.",
