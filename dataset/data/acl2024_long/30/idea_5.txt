    "Title": "Error-Driven Curriculum Learning for LLMs: A Multi-Stage Self-Correction Framework",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-stage self-correction framework for LLMs, where the model is trained on a curriculum of increasingly complex reasoning tasks, with each stage focusing on identifying and correcting specific types of errors. The framework integrates a dynamic error taxonomy that evolves as the model progresses through the curriculum, allowing it to learn from its mistakes in a structured and systematic way. The model is first exposed to simple tasks with clear error patterns, and as it masters these, it moves on to more complex tasks with ambiguous or multi-faceted errors. The framework also includes a feedback loop where the model generates hypotheses about its errors, tests them, and refines its understanding based on the outcomes. This approach not only improves reasoning accuracy but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to unseen tasks.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** and **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which emphasize identifying anomalies and theoretical boundaries in existing approaches. By creating a dynamic error taxonomy and a structured curriculum, we address the limitations of current methods that treat errors as static and homogeneous. Additionally, **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is used to analogically reason about how humans learn from mistakes in a structured way, which is then applied to LLMs. The feedback loop is inspired by **Popper’s falsificationism**, which encourages iterative testing and refinement of hypotheses.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLM fine-tuning methods often treat errors as uniform and fail to account for the diversity and complexity of reasoning mistakes. By introducing a curriculum-based approach with a dynamic error taxonomy, the model can learn more effectively from its mistakes, leading to better generalization and reasoning capabilities. This approach is novel because it combines curriculum learning with error-driven self-correction, which has not been explored in the context of LLMs. The potential impact is significant, as it could lead to more robust and interpretable LLMs that can handle complex reasoning tasks with fewer errors.",
