    "Title": "Multi-Source Citation Aggregation for Enhanced Factual Consistency",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a multi-source citation aggregation framework that combines evidence from diverse knowledge sources (e.g., Wikipedia, scientific papers, news articles) to verify LLM-generated content. The framework uses a graph-based approach to model relationships between citations and identify consensus or contradictions among sources. It also incorporates a confidence scoring mechanism to prioritize highly reliable citations. By aggregating evidence from multiple sources, the framework improves the factual consistency and robustness of LLM outputs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is grounded in **Hansen’s theory of anomalous findings**, which focuses on integrating anomalous or conflicting evidence into a coherent framework. It also draws from **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory**, which emphasizes identifying common patterns and structures across multiple studies. The multi-source approach addresses the limitations of single-source retrieval methods highlighted in the referenced paper 'Retrieval-augmented Generation across Heterogeneous Knowledge.'",
    "Rationale": "Single-source retrieval methods are prone to biases and inaccuracies, especially in complex or controversial topics. By aggregating citations from multiple sources, this framework provides a more comprehensive and balanced verification process. This approach enhances the credibility of LLM-generated content and reduces the risk of hallucination.",
