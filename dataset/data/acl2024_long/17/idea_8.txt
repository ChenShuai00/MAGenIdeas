    "Title": "Interactive Citation Feedback for Continuous Improvement of LLM Responses",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces an interactive citation feedback mechanism that allows users to provide feedback on the citations generated by LLM-based chatbots. The feedback is used to continuously improve the retrieval and citation generation modules, ensuring that the system evolves based on user interactions. The framework includes a user-friendly interface that highlights the citations in the generated responses and allows users to rate their relevance and accuracy. The feedback is then used to fine-tune the retrieval and NLI modules, improving the overall quality of the system over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on the theories of **Design and Improve Existing Methods** (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) and **Scientific Paradigm Shift** (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions). The interactive feedback mechanism introduces a new approach to continuous model improvement, leveraging user feedback to enhance the retrieval and citation generation modules. This aligns with the principles of **Propose New Hypotheses** (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method), as it introduces a novel solution to the challenge of improving LLM responses based on user interactions.",
    "Rationale": "Existing citation generation methods often lack a mechanism for continuous improvement based on user feedback. This framework addresses this limitation by introducing an interactive feedback mechanism that allows users to rate the relevance and accuracy of citations. The feedback is used to fine-tune the retrieval and NLI modules, ensuring that the system evolves based on user interactions. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the quality and reliability of LLM responses, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards.",
