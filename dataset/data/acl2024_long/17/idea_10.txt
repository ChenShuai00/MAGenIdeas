    "Title": "Dynamic Context-Aware Citation Generation for Hallucination Mitigation in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic context-aware citation generation framework that integrates real-time context analysis with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to mitigate hallucinations in LLM-based chatbots. Unlike static citation methods, this approach dynamically adjusts the retrieval process based on the conversational context, ensuring that citations are not only relevant but also contextually aligned with the user's query. The framework includes a context-aware retrieval module, a citation relevance scoring system, and a feedback loop for continuous improvement. This method aims to reduce hallucination rates while maintaining the fluency and coherence of chatbot responses.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** (identifying anomalies in static citation methods) and **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (designing a dynamic, context-aware approach). The rationale is that current citation methods often fail to account for the evolving context of a conversation, leading to irrelevant or outdated citations. By dynamically adjusting the retrieval process, this framework ensures that citations remain contextually relevant, thereby improving the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLM-generated responses.",
    "Rationale": "The dynamic context-aware approach addresses a critical limitation of existing citation methods by integrating real-time context analysis. This innovation has the potential to significantly reduce hallucination rates and improve the user experience, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like ACL and NeurIPS.",
