    "Title": "Multi-Source Knowledge Fusion for Enhanced Citation Generation in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a multi-source knowledge fusion framework that combines information from diverse knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, scientific literature, and domain-specific databases) to enhance citation generation in LLMs. The framework employs a hierarchical retrieval system that prioritizes sources based on their relevance and reliability, followed by a fusion module that integrates the retrieved information into coherent and accurate citations. This approach aims to improve the diversity and accuracy of citations, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations in LLM-generated responses.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory** (abstracting general laws from multiple studies) and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (proposing a new hypothesis for multi-source fusion). The rationale is that relying on a single knowledge source limits the diversity and accuracy of citations. By integrating multiple sources, this framework ensures that citations are both comprehensive and reliable, thereby enhancing the overall quality of LLM-generated content.",
    "Rationale": "The multi-source knowledge fusion framework addresses a key limitation of existing citation methods by leveraging diverse knowledge bases. This innovation has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of LLM-generated responses, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like ICLR and CVPR.",
