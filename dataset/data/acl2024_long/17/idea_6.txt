    "Title": "Unified Hallucination Detection and Correction Framework with Explainable AI",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a unified framework that combines hallucination detection and correction using explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The framework employs a hybrid model that integrates uncertainty-based hallucination detection with a citation-enhanced correction module. The detection module uses attention mechanisms and token-level uncertainty metrics to identify unreliable content, while the correction module leverages retrieval-augmented generation to regenerate responses with citations. The framework also includes an XAI component that provides interpretable explanations for the detected hallucinations and the correction process, enhancing transparency and user trust.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on the theories of **Propose New Hypotheses** (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method) and **Exploring the Limitations and Shortcomings of Current Methods** (Popper’s falsificationism). The hybrid model addresses the limitations of existing hallucination detection methods by combining uncertainty-based detection with retrieval-augmented correction. The inclusion of XAI aligns with the principles of **Scientific Paradigm Shift** (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions), as it introduces a new approach to enhancing transparency and trust in AI systems.",
    "Rationale": "Existing hallucination detection methods often rely on external knowledge or multiple response sampling, which can be costly and inefficient. This framework provides a unified solution that is both efficient and effective, leveraging uncertainty metrics and retrieval-augmented generation to detect and correct hallucinations. The XAI component enhances user trust by providing interpretable explanations, making the framework suitable for real-world applications. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the reliability and transparency of LLM-based chatbots, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards.",
