    "Title": "Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration for Hallucination-Free LLM Responses",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a cross-domain knowledge integration framework that enhances the ability of LLMs to generate accurate and citation-supported responses across diverse domains. The framework uses a domain-aware retrieval system to fetch relevant documents from multiple knowledge sources (e.g., scientific literature, legal texts, and general knowledge databases) and employs a domain-specific natural language inference (NLI) module to generate citations. The system also includes a domain adaptation mechanism that fine-tunes the retrieval and NLI modules based on the specific domain of the user query, ensuring high accuracy and relevance.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of **Define New Scientific Problems** (Kuhn’s paradigm theory) and **Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies** (Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory). The framework addresses the challenge of cross-domain knowledge integration by leveraging domain-aware retrieval and NLI modules. The domain adaptation mechanism aligns with the principles of **Design and Improve Existing Methods** (Laudan’s methodological improvement model), as it introduces a new approach to fine-tuning models for specific domains.",
    "Rationale": "Current LLM-based chatbots often struggle to generate accurate responses across diverse domains due to the limitations of single-domain knowledge sources. This framework addresses this challenge by integrating cross-domain knowledge and employing domain-specific NLI modules. The domain adaptation mechanism ensures that the system remains accurate and relevant across different domains, making it suitable for real-world applications. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of LLM responses across diverse domains, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards.",
