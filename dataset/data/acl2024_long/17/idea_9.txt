    "Title": "Multi-Source Evidence Aggregation for Fact-Checking LLM Responses",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a multi-source evidence aggregation framework that enhances the fact-checking capabilities of LLM-based chatbots. The framework uses a multi-modal retrieval system to fetch evidence from diverse sources (e.g., text, images, and videos) and employs a multi-source natural language inference (NLI) module to verify the factual accuracy of the generated responses. The system also includes a confidence scoring mechanism that assigns a confidence score to each response based on the quality and consistency of the evidence, providing users with a measure of the response’s reliability.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of **Abstract and Summarize the General Laws Behind Multiple Related Studies** (Whewell’s conceptual synthesis theory) and **Design and Improve Existing Methods** (Laudan’s methodological improvement model). The framework addresses the challenge of fact-checking LLM responses by leveraging multi-source evidence aggregation and confidence scoring. This aligns with the principles of **Propose New Hypotheses** (Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method), as it introduces a novel solution to the challenge of verifying the factual accuracy of LLM responses.",
    "Rationale": "Existing fact-checking methods often rely on single-source evidence, limiting their ability to verify the factual accuracy of LLM responses. This framework addresses this limitation by aggregating evidence from multiple sources and employing a multi-source NLI module. The confidence scoring mechanism provides users with a measure of the response’s reliability, enhancing transparency and trust. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the fact-checking capabilities of LLM-based chatbots, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards.",
