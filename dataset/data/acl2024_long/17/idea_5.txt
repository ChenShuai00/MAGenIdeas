    "Title": "Dynamic Context-Aware Citation Generation for Hallucination-Free LLM Responses",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic context-aware citation generation framework that integrates real-time context analysis with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to minimize hallucination in LLM-based chatbots. The framework uses a multi-modal retrieval system to fetch relevant documents from heterogeneous knowledge sources (e.g., structured databases, unstructured text, and multimedia) and employs a context-aware natural language inference (NLI) module to generate citations dynamically. The system also includes a feedback loop that continuously updates the retrieval and citation modules based on user interactions and model performance, ensuring adaptability and scalability across diverse domains.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the theories of **Design and Improve Existing Methods** (Laudan’s methodological improvement model) and **Construct and Modify Theoretical Models** (Quine’s holism). The framework improves upon existing RAG methods by incorporating dynamic context analysis and multi-modal retrieval, addressing the limitations of single-source homogeneous corpora. The feedback loop aligns with the principles of **Scientific Paradigm Shift** (Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions), as it introduces a new approach to continuous model improvement and adaptation.",
    "Rationale": "Current RAG methods primarily rely on unstructured text from sources like Wikipedia, limiting their ability to handle diverse and dynamic knowledge. By integrating multi-modal retrieval and context-aware citation generation, this framework can significantly reduce hallucination and improve the factual accuracy of LLM responses. The feedback loop ensures that the system remains up-to-date and adaptable, making it suitable for real-world applications. This approach has the potential to set a new standard for hallucination-free LLM systems, making it a strong candidate for top conference awards.",
