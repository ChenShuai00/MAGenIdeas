    "Title": "Interactive Citation Feedback for Continuous Improvement in LLMs",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces an interactive citation feedback mechanism that allows users to provide feedback on the relevance and accuracy of citations generated by LLM-based chatbots. The feedback is used to fine-tune the retrieval and citation generation modules, enabling continuous improvement of the system. The framework includes a user feedback interface, a feedback analysis module, and a model update mechanism that ensures the system evolves based on user input. This approach aims to enhance the user experience by making citations more relevant and accurate over time.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** (designing a feedback-driven improvement mechanism) and **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** (proposing a new hypothesis for interactive feedback). The rationale is that current citation methods lack a mechanism for incorporating user feedback, limiting their ability to improve over time. By introducing an interactive feedback mechanism, this framework ensures that the system continuously evolves to meet user needs.",
    "Rationale": "The interactive citation feedback mechanism addresses a key limitation of existing citation methods by incorporating user feedback. This innovation has the potential to significantly improve the relevance and accuracy of citations over time, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences like ICLR and CVPR.",
