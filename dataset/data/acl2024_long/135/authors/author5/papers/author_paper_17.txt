    "title": "KBAlign: Efficient Self Adaptation on Specific Knowledge Bases",
    "abstract": "Humans can utilize techniques to quickly acquire knowledge from specific materials in advance, such as creating self-assessment questions, enabling us to achieving related tasks more efficiently. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) usually relies on retrieval-augmented generation to exploit knowledge materials in an instant manner, or requires external signals such as human preference data and stronger LLM annotations to conduct knowledge adaptation. To unleash the self-learning potential of LLMs, we propose KBAlign, an approach designed for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks involving knowledge bases. Our method utilizes iterative training with self-annotated data such as Q&A pairs and revision suggestions, enabling the model to grasp the knowledge content efficiently. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly boosting model performance in downstream tasks that require specific knowledge at a low cost. Notably, our approach achieves over 90% of the performance improvement that can be obtained by using GPT-4-turbo annotation, while relying entirely on self-supervision. We release our experimental data, models, and process analyses to the community for further exploration (https://github.com/thunlp/KBAlign)."
