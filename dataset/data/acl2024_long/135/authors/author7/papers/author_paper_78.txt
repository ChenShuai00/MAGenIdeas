    "title": "BARCOR: Towards A Uni\ufb01ed Framework for Conversational Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommendation systems focus on helping 001 users \ufb01nd items of interest in the situations 002 of information overload, where users\u2019 prefer-003 ences are typically estimated by past observed 004 behaviors. In contrast, conversational recom-005 mendation systems (CRS) aim to understand 006 users\u2019 preferences via interactions in conver-007 sation \ufb02ows. CRS is a complex problem that 008 consists of two main tasks: (1) recommenda-009 tion and (2) response generation. Previous 010 work often tried to solve the problem in a 011 modular manner, where recommenders and re-012 sponse generators are separate neural models. 013 Such modular architectures often come with 014 a complicated and unintuitive connection be-015 tween the modules, leading to inef\ufb01cient learn-016 ing and other issues. In this work, we pro-017 pose a uni\ufb01ed framework based on BART for 018 conversational recommendation, which tack-019 les two tasks in a single model. Furthermore, 020 we also design and collect a lightweight knowl-021 edge graph for CRS in the movie domain. The 022 experimental results show that the proposed 023 methods achieve the state-of-the-art. 1 024"
