    "title": "MTGAT: Multimodal Temporal Graph Attention Networks for Unaligned Human Multimodal Language Sequences",
    "abstract": "Human communication is multimodal in nature; it is through multiple modalities, i.e., language, voice, and facial expressions, that opinions and emotions are expressed. Data in this domain exhibits complex multi-relational and temporal interactions. Learning from this data is a fundamentally challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Temporal Graph Attention Networks (MTGAT). MTGAT is an interpretable graph-based neural model that provides a suitable framework for analyzing this type of multimodal sequential data. We first introduce a procedure to convert unaligned multimodal sequence data into a graph with heterogeneous nodes and edges that captures the rich interactions between different modalities through time. Then, a novel graph operation, called Multimodal Temporal Graph Attention, along with a dynamic pruning and read-out technique is designed to efficiently process this multimodal temporal graph. By learning to focus only on the important interactions within the graph, our MTGAT is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition benchmarks including IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSI, while utilizing significantly fewer computations."
