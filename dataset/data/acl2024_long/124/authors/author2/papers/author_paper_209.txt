    "title": "Beyond Text based sentiment analysis : Towards multi-modal systems",
    "abstract": "A huge number of videos are posted each day on social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook etc. It makes the Internet an almost unlimited source of information. In the coming decades it will become increasingly challenging for researchers to cope with this information and mine useful knowledge from it. In this paper, we address the problem of multimodal sentiment analysis i.e. harvesting sentiment from Web videos by demonstrating a novel model which uses audio,visual and textual modalities as sources of information. Here, we first extract information from three modalities and then fuse these at both feature and decision level. We employ a kernel based fusion method to fuse the information extracted from multiple modalities. A thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art works in this area is carried out. In preliminary experiments using the YouTube dataset, our proposed multimodal system is shown to achieve an accuracy of 78.20%,outperforming the best state-of-the-art systems by more than 22.90%."
