    "abstract": "Capsule-based network has currently identi-001 \ufb01ed its effectiveness in analyzing the hetero-002 geneity issue of multimodal sentiment analy-003 sis. However, existing manners could only 004 exploit the spatial relation between represen-005 tation and output layer via down-top atten-006 tion, which fails to effectively explore both 007 inter-modality and intra-modality context. In 008 this paper, during the preprocess period, we 009 \ufb01rst present the multimodal dynamic enhanced 010 module to facilitate the intra-modality con-011 text, which signi\ufb01cantly boost the learning ef\ufb01-012 ciency in dealing with multimodal heterogene-013 ity issue. Furthermore, the bi-direction atten-014 tion capsule-based network (BACN) is pro-015 posed to capture dynamic inter-modality con-016 text via the novel bi-direction dynamic routing 017 mechanism. Speci\ufb01cally, BACN \ufb01rstly high-018 lights the static and low-level inter-modality 019 context based on top-down attention. Then, 020 the static multimodal context is transmitted to 021 dynamic routing procedure, naturally allowing 022 us to investigate dynamic and high-level inter-023 modality context. This indeed unleash the ex-024 pressive power and provides the superior ca-025 pability to bridge the modality gap among all 026 the modalities. The experiments demonstrate 027 that BACN can achieve state-of-the-art perfor-028 mance. 029"
