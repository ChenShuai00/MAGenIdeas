    "title": "Utterance-level Dialogue Understanding: An Empirical Study",
    "abstract": "The recent abundance of conversational data on the Web and elsewhere calls for effective NLP systems for dialog understanding. Complete utterance-level understanding often requires context understanding, defined by nearby utterances. In recent years, a number of approaches have been proposed for various utterance-level dialogue understanding tasks. Most of these approaches account for the context for effective understanding. In this paper, we explore and quantify the role of context for different aspects of a dialogue, namely emotion, intent, and dialogue act identification, using state-of-the-art dialog understanding methods as baselines. Specifically, we employ various perturbations to distort the context of a given utterance and study its impact on the different tasks and baselines. This provides us with insights into the fundamental contextual controlling factors of different aspects of a dialogue. Such insights can inspire more effective dialogue understanding models, and provide support for future text generation approaches. The implementation pertaining to this work is available at this https URL."
