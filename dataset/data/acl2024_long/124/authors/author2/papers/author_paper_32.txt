    "title": "Not All Votes Count! Programs as Verifiers Improve Self-Consistency of Language Models for Math Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing proficiency in solving mathematical reasoning problems. However, many current open-source LLMs often still make calculation and semantic understanding errors in their intermediate reasoning steps. In this work, we propose PROVE, a simple yet effective framework that uses program-based verification as a heuristic to filter out potentially incorrect reasoning paths before aggregating the final answers. Instead of relying on vanilla majority voting, our approach rejects solutions whose corresponding program outputs are inconsistent with the generated solution, aggregating only those validated by Python programs. We conducted extensive experiments on 13 open-source LLMs from various model families and sizes, ranging from 0.5B to 13B parameters, across seven math benchmarks. We demonstrate that PROVE consistently outperforms vanilla majority voting as a heuristic for solving mathematical reasoning tasks across all datasets and model sizes. Notably, PROVE increases accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark from 48.85% to 53.83% for Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct, from 65.66% to 73.01% for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, from 73.39% to 79.61% for Gemma-2-2b-it, and from 41.32% to 59.51% for Llama-2-7B-chat.
