    "title": "Analysis of Twitter Data Using Classification Approach",
    "abstract": "-The evolution of web technology has led to a huge amount of user generated content and has significantly changed the way one manages, organizes and interacts with information. sentiment analysis has emerged as one of the popular techniques for information retrieval and web data analysis. In the present paper machine learning classification approaches with different feature selection schemes to obtain a sentiment analysis model for the twitter dataset has been explored. The proposed approach uses a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The work has been performed using Rapid Miner tool. From the Results and Analysis it is seen that the performance of this SVM Model has a better accuracy of 81.50%, with the recall of both positive and negative sentiments being more or less same, each being 83% and 80% respectively. Also the model performance has RMSE value of 0.395 and Absolute error of 0.369, which again clearly demonstrates the good predictive capability of the model."
