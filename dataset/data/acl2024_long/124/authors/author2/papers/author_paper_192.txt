    "title": "Sentic LDA: Improving on LDA with semantic similarity for aspect-based sentiment analysis",
    "abstract": "The advent of the Social Web has provided netizens with new tools for creating and sharing, in a time- and cost-efficient way, their contents, ideas, and opinions with virtually the millions of people connected to the World Wide Web. This huge amount of information, however, is mainly unstructured as specifically produced for human consumption and, hence, it is not directly machine-processable. In order to enable a more efficient passage from unstructured information to structured data, aspect-based opinion mining models the relations between opinion targets contained in a document and the polarity values associated with these. Because aspects are often implicit, however, spotting them and calculating their respective polarity is an extremely difficult task, which is closer to natural language understanding rather than natural language processing. To this end, Sentic LDA exploits common-sense reasoning to shift LDA clustering from a syntactic to a semantic level. Rather than looking at word co-occurrence frequencies, Sentic LDA leverages on the semantics associated with words and multi-word expressions to improve clustering and, hence, outperform state-of-the-art techniques for aspect extraction."
