    "title": "ADAPTERMIX: Exploring the Efficacy of Mixture of Adapters for Low-Resource TTS Adaptation",
    "abstract": "There are significant challenges for speaker adaptation in text-to-speech for languages that are not widely spoken or for speakers with accents or dialects that are not well-represented in the training data. To address this issue, we propose the use of the\"mixture of adapters\"method. This approach involves adding multiple adapters within a backbone-model layer to learn the unique characteristics of different speakers. Our approach outperforms the baseline, with a noticeable improvement of 5% observed in speaker preference tests when using only one minute of data for each new speaker. Moreover, following the adapter paradigm, we fine-tune only the adapter parameters (11% of the total model parameters). This is a significant achievement in parameter-efficient speaker adaptation, and one of the first models of its kind. Overall, our proposed approach offers a promising solution to the speech synthesis techniques, particularly for adapting to speakers from diverse backgrounds."
