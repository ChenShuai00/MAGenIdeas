    "title": "Multi-level Multiple Attentions for Contextual Multimodal Sentiment Analysis",
    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis involves identifying sentiment in videos and is a developing field of research. Unlike current works, which model utterances individually, we propose a recurrent model that is able to capture contextual information among utterances. In this paper, we also introduce attentionbased networks for improving both context learning and dynamic feature fusion. Our model shows 6-8% improvement over the state of the art on a benchmark dataset."
