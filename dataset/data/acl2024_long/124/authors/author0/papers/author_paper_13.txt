    "abstract": "The mobility of a large number of workers is essential if several types of sensing tasks are to be completed with increased adaptability and at reduced expense. However, in order to make use of it, the conventional MCS requires an excessive amount of computer power and data storage space. This is because the traditional MCS has a high resource consumption rate for communication during the transmission of raw data. A revolutionary MCS learning framework that includes four main components is presented by us as an alternative. This structure takes use of There have been a number of studies conducted on blockchain-based MCS and FL; however, these studies have not been able to solve the fundamental problems with MCS in terms of or address the privacy issues that have been brought up by requestors and workers who are participating in the learning process but have limited resources. To ensure that the information stored on smart phones is kept confidential, our company suggests implementing a data submission policy that is based on the structure of the underlying mechanism."
