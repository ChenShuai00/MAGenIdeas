    "Title": "Cross-Modal Mixture-of-Experts for Multimodal Language Models",
    "Idea": "This idea extends the MoE architecture to multimodal language models by introducing cross-modal experts. Each expert is specialized in processing a specific modality (e.g., text, image, audio) or cross-modal interactions. The routing mechanism is designed to activate the most relevant experts based on the input modalities. This approach enables the model to effectively handle multimodal inputs and tasks, improving its versatility and performance.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** and **Kitcher’s unified theory of science**. The paradigm shift involves extending MoE architectures to multimodal domains, which is a natural evolution given the increasing importance of multimodal AI. The unified theory ensures that the model can integrate knowledge across different modalities, leading to more robust performance.",
    "Rationale": "Current MoE architectures are primarily designed for unimodal tasks, limiting their applicability to multimodal domains. Cross-modal MoE addresses this limitation by introducing experts specialized in different modalities and their interactions. This idea is innovative and has the potential to significantly advance multimodal AI, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
