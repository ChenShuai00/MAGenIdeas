    "Title": "Dynamic Expert Allocation in Mixture-of-Experts Models for Task-Specific Specialization",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a dynamic expert allocation mechanism in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, where the number of experts activated is determined by the complexity of the input task. Unlike traditional MoE models that activate a fixed number of experts (top-K), this approach dynamically adjusts the number of experts based on the task's requirements, ensuring that more complex tasks receive more computational resources. The mechanism could be implemented using a lightweight neural network that predicts task complexity and routes the input to an appropriate number of experts. This approach aims to further enhance expert specialization by ensuring that each expert is only activated when necessary, reducing redundancy and improving computational efficiency.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is derived from the 'Define New Scientific Problems' and 'Propose New Hypotheses' theories. The target paper identifies the challenge of expert specialization in MoE models, and this idea extends that by introducing a new problem: how to dynamically allocate experts based on task complexity. The hypothesis is that dynamic expert allocation can lead to better specialization and efficiency, which is tested through the proposed mechanism.",
    "Rationale": "Current MoE models activate a fixed number of experts, which may not be optimal for all tasks. By dynamically adjusting the number of experts based on task complexity, this idea ensures that resources are allocated more efficiently, leading to better performance and reduced computational costs. This approach could be particularly useful in scenarios where tasks vary widely in complexity, such as in multi-task learning or real-time applications.",
