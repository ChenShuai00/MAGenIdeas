    "title": "Flourishing electronic textiles towards pervasive, personalized and intelligent healthcare",
    "abstract": "In the face of pandemic infectious diseases and increasing aging trends, traditional public health systems lack the capacity for real-time monitoring, immediate clinical detection, continuous vital sign monitoring, and the implementation of long-cycle treatment protocols, among other deficiencies. On the basis of the rapid development of wearable electronic devices, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, the future healthcare model will transform from a therapeutic, centralized, passive, and even one-size-fits-all treatment to a new paradigm of proactive, preventive, personalized, customized, and intelligent way. The development of wearable electronics has facilitated the evolution of healthcare from healthcare to biological monitoring, enabling continuous monitoring of critical biomarkers for diagnostic treatment, physiological health monitoring, and assessment. Electronic textiles (e-textiles) are among the rapidly developing wearable electronics in recent years. They have revolutionized the functionality of traditional textiles by incorporating smart attributes, enabling unique and multifunctional applications. Significantly, e-textiles have made notable advancements in the field of personalized healthcare. The article introduces several common e-textiles and their applications in personalized medicines, which also gives a forward-looking outlook on their future growth in infectious diseases, real-time health preventive monitoring, auxiliary therapy, and rehabilitation training."
