    "title": "A Multi-View Fusion Neural Network for Answer Selection",
    "abstract": "\n \n Community question answering aims at choosing the most appropriate answer for a given question, which is important in many NLP applications. Previous neural network-based methods consider several different aspects of information through calculating attentions. These different kinds of attentions are always simply summed up and can be seen as a ``single view\", causing severe information loss. To overcome this problem, we propose a Multi-View Fusion Neural Network, where each attention component generates a ``view'' of the QA pair and a fusion RNN integrates the generated views to form a more holistic representation.\u00a0 \u00a0 In this fusion RNN method, a filter gate\u00a0 collects\u00a0 important information of\u00a0 input and directly adds it to the output, which borrows the idea of residual networks.\u00a0 \u00a0 Experimental results on the WikiQA and SemEval-2016 CQA datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n \n"
