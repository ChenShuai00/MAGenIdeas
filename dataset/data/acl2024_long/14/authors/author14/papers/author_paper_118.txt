    "title": "Encoding Temporal Information for Time-Aware Link Prediction",
    "abstract": "Most existing knowledge base (KB) embedding methods solely learn from time-unknown fact triples but neglect the temporal information in the knowledge base. In this paper, we propose a novel time-aware KB embedding approach taking advantage of the happening time of facts. Speci\ufb01cally, we use temporal order constraints to model transformation between time-sensitive relations and enforce the embeddings to be temporally consistent and more accurate. We empirically evaluate our approach in two tasks of link prediction and triple classi\ufb01cation. Experimental re-sults show that our method outperforms other baselines on the two tasks consistently."
