    "Title": "Hybrid MoE-Dense Models: Combining the Strengths of Sparse and Dense Architectures",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes a hybrid architecture that combines Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with dense models to leverage the strengths of both. In this architecture, certain layers of the model use MoE for computational efficiency, while others use dense layers for tasks requiring more general knowledge. The hybrid model could dynamically switch between MoE and dense layers based on the task, ensuring that the model is both efficient and versatile. This approach aims to address the limitations of pure MoE models, which may struggle with tasks requiring broad, general knowledge.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is derived from the 'Scientific Paradigm Shift' theory. The target paper represents a shift towards more efficient MoE models, and this idea explores how this shift could lead to hybrid architectures that combine the strengths of MoE and dense models. The hypothesis is that such a hybrid model could achieve better performance across a wider range of tasks, which is tested through the proposed architecture.",
    "Rationale": "While MoE models are efficient, they may not perform as well as dense models on tasks requiring general knowledge. By combining MoE and dense layers, this idea aims to create a model that is both efficient and versatile, capable of handling a wide range of tasks. This approach could be particularly useful in applications like multi-task learning or transfer learning, where the model needs to adapt to different types of tasks.",
