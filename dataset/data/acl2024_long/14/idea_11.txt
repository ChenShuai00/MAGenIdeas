    "Title": "Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts for Multi-Granularity Knowledge Representation",
    "Idea": "This idea introduces a hierarchical MoE architecture where experts are organized into multiple levels of granularity. Lower-level experts capture fine-grained knowledge, while higher-level experts handle coarse-grained knowledge. The routing mechanism is designed to activate experts at the appropriate level based on the input's complexity. This hierarchical structure enables the model to represent knowledge at multiple scales, improving its ability to handle diverse tasks and inputs.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is based on **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** and **Quine’s holism**. The paradigm shift involves moving from flat MoE architectures to hierarchical ones, which better align with the multi-granularity nature of knowledge. The holistic approach ensures that the model can integrate knowledge across different levels of granularity, leading to more robust and versatile performance.",
    "Rationale": "Flat MoE architectures may struggle to represent knowledge at multiple scales, limiting their versatility. A hierarchical MoE architecture addresses this limitation by organizing experts into levels of granularity, enabling the model to handle a wider range of tasks and inputs. This idea is innovative and has the potential to significantly improve MoE models' performance, making it a strong candidate for a best paper award.",
