    "Title": "MoE for Multimodal Learning: Specializing Experts Across Modalities",
    "Idea": "This idea explores the use of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models in multimodal learning, where different experts specialize in different modalities (e.g., text, image, audio). The routing mechanism in the MoE model would be designed to activate experts based on the modality of the input, ensuring that each expert focuses on its specialized domain. This approach could lead to more efficient and effective multimodal models, particularly in tasks requiring the integration of multiple modalities, such as image captioning or video understanding.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is derived from the 'Define New Scientific Problems' and 'Propose New Hypotheses' theories. The target paper focuses on expert specialization in language models, and this idea extends it to multimodal learning. The hypothesis is that MoE models can be adapted to specialize experts across different modalities, which is tested through the proposed approach.",
    "Rationale": "Multimodal learning often requires the integration of information from different modalities, which can be computationally expensive. By using MoE models with modality-specific experts, this idea aims to improve both efficiency and performance in multimodal tasks. This approach could be particularly useful in applications like multimodal translation or cross-modal retrieval.",
