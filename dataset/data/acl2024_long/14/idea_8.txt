    "Title": "Expert Specialization through Neurosymbolic Integration in MoE Models",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes integrating neurosymbolic approaches into Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to enhance expert specialization. Neurosymbolic methods, which combine neural networks with symbolic reasoning, could be used to guide the routing mechanism in MoE models, ensuring that experts are activated based on both learned patterns and symbolic rules. This approach could lead to more interpretable and specialized experts, particularly in tasks requiring logical reasoning or structured knowledge.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by the 'Construct and Modify Theoretical Models' theory. The target paper focuses on expert specialization, and this idea extends it by integrating neurosymbolic approaches to enhance specialization. The hypothesis is that neurosymbolic methods can improve both the interpretability and specialization of experts, which is tested through the proposed integration.",
    "Rationale": "Neurosymbolic methods have been shown to improve the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of neural networks. By integrating these methods into MoE models, this idea aims to create more specialized and interpretable experts, particularly in tasks requiring logical reasoning or structured knowledge. This approach could be particularly beneficial in applications like question answering or knowledge graph completion.",
