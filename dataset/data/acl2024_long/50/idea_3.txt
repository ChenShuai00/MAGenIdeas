    "Title": "CodeScope-Secure: Secure Code Generation with Adversarial Robustness",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes CodeScope-Secure, a framework that integrates adversarial robustness into code generation to ensure secure and reliable code. CodeScope-Secure will introduce a 'Security Analyzer' that identifies potential vulnerabilities in generated code and provides suggestions for secure alternatives. The framework will also include an 'Adversarial Training Module' that exposes the model to adversarial examples during training, improving its robustness against malicious inputs. CodeScope-Secure will be evaluated on a new benchmark dataset, CodeScope-SecureBench, which includes code examples with known vulnerabilities and adversarial attacks. The framework will introduce a novel evaluation metric, 'Security Robustness Score (SRS)', to measure the model’s ability to generate secure code.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which highlights the need for new paradigms when existing theories fail to address critical issues. Current code generation models lack robustness against adversarial attacks, which is a significant gap in their practical application. **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** is used to analogically reason that adversarial robustness techniques from other domains (e.g., cybersecurity, image recognition) can be adapted to code generation. **Lakatos’s research program methodology** is used to critically analyze the limitations of current models and propose improvements through adversarial training. Finally, **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** is applied to construct a unified framework that bridges code generation, security, and robustness.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the increasing importance of secure code generation in software development. By integrating adversarial robustness, CodeScope-Secure addresses the limitations of current models and improves their reliability in real-world scenarios. This idea has the potential to significantly impact the field by making code generation models more secure and trustworthy, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences.",
