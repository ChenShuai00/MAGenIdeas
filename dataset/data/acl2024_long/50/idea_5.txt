    "Title": "CodeScope++: A Dynamic, Real-Time Execution and Feedback Framework for Evaluating LLMs on Code Generation",
    "Idea": "CodeScope++ extends the CodeScope benchmark by introducing a dynamic, real-time execution and feedback framework. Unlike static benchmarks, CodeScope++ evaluates LLMs in real-time by integrating a live code execution engine that continuously monitors and provides feedback on the correctness, efficiency, and robustness of generated code. The framework also includes a multi-agent system where LLMs interact with simulated developers and users, enabling evaluation in collaborative and iterative coding scenarios. This approach addresses the limitations of static benchmarks by capturing the dynamic nature of real-world software development, where code is continuously refined and tested. The framework will support 50+ programming languages and include metrics for real-time performance, adaptability, and user satisfaction.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** and **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which emphasize identifying anomalies in existing paradigms and solving practical problems. Current benchmarks like CodeScope are static and do not account for the iterative and collaborative nature of real-world coding. By proposing a dynamic, real-time evaluation framework, we address this gap. Additionally, **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is used to hypothesize that real-time feedback and multi-agent interaction will lead to more accurate and practical evaluations of LLMs. Finally, **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** guides the integration of new technologies, such as live code execution engines and multi-agent systems, to enhance the benchmark.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea is that static benchmarks fail to capture the dynamic and collaborative aspects of real-world software development. By introducing real-time execution and feedback, CodeScope++ provides a more realistic evaluation of LLMs, which is crucial for their deployment in practical applications. This approach also aligns with the growing demand for LLMs that can adapt to changing requirements and collaborate with human developers. The inclusion of multi-agent interaction and real-time metrics ensures that the benchmark is both comprehensive and forward-looking, making it a strong candidate for top-tier conferences.",
