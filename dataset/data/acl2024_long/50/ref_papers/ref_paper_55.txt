    "title": "Staged program repair with condition synthesis",
    "abstract": "We present SPR, a new program repair system that combines staged program repair and condition synthesis. These techniques enable SPR to work productively with a set of parameterized transformation schemas to generate and efficiently search a rich space of program repairs. Together these techniques enable SPR to generate correct repairs for over five times as many defects as previous systems evaluated on the same benchmark set."
