    "Title": "CodeScope-X: A Unified Framework for Cross-Lingual Code Understanding and Generation with Dynamic Execution Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes CodeScope-X, an extension of CodeScope, which integrates dynamic execution feedback into a unified framework for cross-lingual code understanding and generation. CodeScope-X will not only evaluate code generation based on static metrics but also incorporate real-time execution results across multiple programming languages. The framework will include a novel 'Execution Feedback Loop' that dynamically adjusts the evaluation criteria based on runtime performance, ensuring that generated code is not only syntactically correct but also functionally accurate. Additionally, CodeScope-X will introduce a 'Cross-Lingual Semantic Alignment' module that leverages multilingual embeddings to improve code translation and understanding across languages. This framework will be evaluated on a new benchmark dataset, CodeScope-XBench, which includes diverse programming tasks across 50+ languages and real-world software development scenarios.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** and **Laudan’s problem-solving model**, which emphasize identifying anomalies in existing theories and exploring new problems. The current benchmarks, including CodeScope, focus on static evaluation and lack dynamic execution feedback, which is a significant gap. By integrating dynamic execution feedback, we address this anomaly and propose a new paradigm for code evaluation. **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** is used to analogically reason that dynamic feedback loops in other domains (e.g., reinforcement learning) can be applied to code generation. **Lakatos’s research program methodology** is used to critically analyze the limitations of static evaluation methods and propose improvements. Finally, **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** is applied to construct a unified framework that bridges code understanding, generation, and execution across languages.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the growing need for LLMs to generate executable and functionally accurate code across multiple languages. Current benchmarks fail to capture the dynamic nature of code execution, leading to a gap between evaluation metrics and real-world performance. By introducing dynamic execution feedback and cross-lingual semantic alignment, CodeScope-X addresses this gap and provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework. This idea has the potential to significantly impact the field by improving the reliability and applicability of LLMs in multilingual software development, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences.",
