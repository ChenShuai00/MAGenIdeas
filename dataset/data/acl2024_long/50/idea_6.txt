    "Title": "CodeScope-X: A Cross-Lingual, Cross-Domain Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Code Translation and Adaptation",
    "Idea": "CodeScope-X introduces a cross-lingual, cross-domain benchmark to evaluate LLMs on code translation and adaptation tasks. The benchmark includes code snippets from 50+ programming languages and spans multiple domains, such as web development, data science, and embedded systems. Each task requires LLMs to translate code between languages or adapt code from one domain to another, while maintaining functionality and efficiency. The benchmark also includes a novel metric, 'Adaptation Quality Score (AQS)', which measures the semantic and functional equivalence of translated or adapted code. CodeScope-X aims to push the boundaries of LLM capabilities in handling diverse programming paradigms and domain-specific challenges.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is rooted in **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which highlights the need to explore theoretical boundaries and integrate interdisciplinary knowledge. Current benchmarks like CodeScope focus on monolingual and single-domain tasks, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs for cross-lingual and cross-domain scenarios. By proposing CodeScope-X, we address this gap and challenge LLMs to handle more complex and diverse tasks. **Pierce’s hypothetical deduction method** is used to hypothesize that LLMs can generalize across languages and domains, while **Laudan’s methodological improvement model** guides the development of the AQS metric to ensure robust evaluation.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for CodeScope-X is that real-world software development often involves working with multiple programming languages and domains. Evaluating LLMs on cross-lingual and cross-domain tasks is crucial for their practical applicability. The inclusion of the AQS metric ensures that the benchmark captures both syntactic and semantic correctness, providing a more holistic evaluation. This idea has the potential to significantly advance the field of code translation and adaptation, making it a strong candidate for top conferences.",
