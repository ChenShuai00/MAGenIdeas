    "Title": "CodeScope-Interactive: Interactive Code Generation with Human-in-the-Loop Feedback",
    "Idea": "This idea proposes CodeScope-Interactive, a framework that integrates human-in-the-loop feedback into code generation to improve the quality and relevance of generated code. CodeScope-Interactive will introduce a 'Human Feedback Module' that allows developers to provide real-time feedback on generated code, which is used to refine the model’s output. The framework will also include a 'Feedback Learning Mechanism' that continuously updates the model based on user feedback, improving its performance over time. CodeScope-Interactive will be evaluated on a new benchmark dataset, CodeScope-InteractiveBench, which includes interactive coding tasks with human feedback annotations. The framework will introduce a novel evaluation metric, 'Feedback Quality Score (FQS)', to measure the effectiveness of human feedback in improving code generation.",
    "Thinking": "This idea is inspired by **Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, which emphasizes the need for new paradigms to address emerging challenges. Current code generation models lack interactivity, which is a significant gap in their practical application. **Simon’s scientific discovery as problem-solving** is used to analogically reason that human-in-the-loop techniques from other domains (e.g., human-computer interaction, reinforcement learning) can be adapted to code generation. **Lakatos’s research program methodology** is used to critically analyze the limitations of static code generation approaches and propose improvements through interactive feedback. Finally, **Kitcher’s unified theory of science** is applied to construct a unified framework that bridges code generation, human feedback, and continuous learning.",
    "Rationale": "The rationale for this idea lies in the growing need for interactive and user-friendly code generation tools. By integrating human-in-the-loop feedback, CodeScope-Interactive addresses the limitations of current models and improves their relevance and usability in real-world scenarios. This idea has the potential to significantly impact the field by making code generation models more interactive and adaptive, making it a strong candidate for best paper awards at top conferences.",
