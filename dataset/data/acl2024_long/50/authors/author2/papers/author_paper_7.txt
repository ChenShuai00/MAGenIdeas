    "title": "DemiNet: Dependency-Aware Multi-Interest Network with Self-Supervised Graph Learning for Click-Through Rate Prediction",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel model named DemiNet (short for DEpendency-Aware Multi-Interest Network) to address the above two issues. To be specific, we first consider various dependency types between item nodes and perform dependency-aware heterogeneous attention for denoising and obtaining accurate sequence item representations. Secondly, for multiple interests extraction, multi-head attention is conducted on top of the graph embedding. To filter out noisy inter-item correlations and enhance the robustness of extracted interests, self-supervised interest learning is introduced to the above two steps. Thirdly, to aggregate the multiple interests, interest experts corresponding to different interest routes give rating scores respectively, while a specialized network assigns the confidence of each score. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed DemiNet significantly improves the overall recommendation performance over several state-of-the-art baselines. Further studies verify the efficacy and interpretability benefits brought by the fine-grained user interest modeling."
