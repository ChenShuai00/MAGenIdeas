    "title": "Hierarchical Regression Network for Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images",
    "abstract": "Capturing visual image with a hyperspectral camera has been successfully applied to many areas due to its narrowband imaging technology. Hyperspectral reconstruction from RGB images denotes a reverse process of hyperspectral imaging by discovering an inverse response function. Current works mainly map RGB images directly to corresponding spectrum but do not consider context information explicitly. Moreover, the use of encoder-decoder pair in current algorithms leads to loss of information. To address these problems, we propose a 4-level Hierarchical Regression Network (HRNet) with PixelShuffle layer as inter-level interaction. Furthermore, we adopt a residual dense block to remove artifacts of real world RGB images and a residual global block to build attention mechanism for enlarging perceptive field. We evaluate proposed HRNet with other architectures and techniques by participating in NTIRE 2020 Challenge on Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images. The HRNet is the winning method of track 2 - real world images and ranks 3rd on track 1 - clean images."
