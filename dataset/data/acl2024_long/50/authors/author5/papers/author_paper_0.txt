    "title": "Enhancing Historical Image Retrieval with Compositional Cues",
    "abstract": "In analyzing vast amounts of digitally stored historical image data, existing content-based retrieval methods often overlook significant non-semantic information, limiting their effectiveness for flexible exploration across varied themes. To broaden the applicability of image retrieval methods for diverse purposes and uncover more general patterns, we innovatively introduce a crucial factor from computational aesthetics, namely image composition, into this topic. By explicitly integrating composition-related information extracted by CNN into the designed retrieval model, our method considers both the image's composition rules and semantic information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the image retrieval network guided by composition information outperforms those relying solely on content information, facilitating the identification of images in databases closer to the target image in human perception.
