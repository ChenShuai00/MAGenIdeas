    "title": "Legacy Photo Editing with Learned Noise Prior",
    "abstract": "There are quite a number of photographs captured under undesirable conditions in the last century. Thus, they are of-ten noisy, regionally incomplete, and grayscale formatted. Conventional approaches mainly focus on one point so that those restoration results are not perceptually sharp or clean enough. To solve these problems, we propose a noise prior learner NEGAN to simulate the noise distribution of real legacy photos using unpaired images. It mainly focuses on matching high-frequency parts of noisy images through discrete wavelet transform (DWT) since they include most of noise statistics. We also create a large legacy photo dataset for learning noise prior. Using learned noise prior, we can easily build valid training pairs by degrading clean images. Then, we propose an IEGAN framework performing image editing including joint denoising, inpainting and colorization based on the estimated noise prior. We evaluate the proposed system and compare it with state-of-the-art image enhancement methods. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves the best perceptual quality. Please see the webpage https://github.com/zhaoyuzhi/Legacy-Photo-Editing-with-Learned-Noise-Prior for the codes and the proposed LP dataset."
