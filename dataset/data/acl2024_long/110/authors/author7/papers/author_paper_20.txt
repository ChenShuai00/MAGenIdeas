    "title": "WorldWeaver: Procedural World Generation for Text Adventure Games using Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Text-based adventure game generation has at-tracted considerable interest since the advancements in large language models. However, even state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs) face challenges in generating semantically and logically coherent content, and often fail to align with human intentions. In our work, we propose a procedural world-generation approach for enhancing content coherence, additionally allowing humans in the loop to better match their intentions. Specifically, we generate game components, including locations, characters, items, actions, and blocks, and integrate these components with semantic and logical constraints. Meanwhile, human game creators can intervene and modify the components to suit their preferences. Evaluation results demonstrate that our procedural world-generation approach both enriches the content and satisfies semantic and logical requirements compared to the SOTA LLMs. Moreover, the human-in-the-loop feature gives game creators more control over generated content. Our project code can be found on GitHub 1 ."
