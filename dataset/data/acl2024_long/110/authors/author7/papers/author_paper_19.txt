    "title": "Few-shot Controllable Style Transfer for Low-Resource Multilinugal Settings",
    "abstract": "Style transfer is the task of rewriting an in-001 put sentence into a target style while approx-002 imately preserving its content. While most 003 prior literature assumes access to large style-004 labelled corpora, recent work (Riley et al., 005 2021) has attempted \u201cfew-shot\u201d style transfer 006 using only 3-10 sentences at inference for ex-007 tracting the target style. In this work we study 008 a relevant low-resource setting: style trans-009 fer for languages where no style-labelled cor-010 pora are available. We \ufb01nd that existing few-011 shot methods perform this task poorly, with a 012 strong tendency to copy inputs verbatim . 013 We push the state-of-the-art for few-shot 014 style transfer with a new method modeling 015 the stylistic difference between paraphrases. 016 When compared to prior work using automatic 017 and human evaluations, our model achieves 018 2-3x better performance and output diversity 019 in formality transfer and code-mixing addi-020 tion across seven languages. Moreover, our 021 method is better able to control the amount 022 of style transfer using an input scalar knob. 023 We report promising qualitative results for sev-024 eral attribute transfer directions, including sen-025 timent transfer, text simpli\ufb01cation, gender neu-026 tralization and text anonymization, all without 027 retraining the model . Finally we found model 028 evaluation to be dif\ufb01cult due to the lack of 029 evaluation datasets and metrics for many lan-030 guages. To facilitate further research in for-031 mality transfer for Indic languages, we crowd-032 source annotations for 4000 sentence pairs in 033 four languages, and use this dataset 1 to design 034 our automatic evaluation suite. 035"
