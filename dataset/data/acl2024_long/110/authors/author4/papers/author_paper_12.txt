    "title": "DAGGER: Data Augmentation for Generative Gaming in Enriched Realms",
    "abstract": "DAGGER is a synthetically generated dataset for creating text adventure games from fiction and for generating prose from game states. It extends the LIGHT dataset by enhancing the original game locations with new characters and items generated using GPT-4. Additionally, each location is paired with a piece of short fiction, totaling 259,582 words across the entire dataset. DAGGER was created using a novel methodology that leverages the capabilities of GPT-4 and a new tool called DataDreamer, which simplifies the implementation of complex prompting workflows and enables the generation of high-quality synthetic training data. The DAGGER dataset is used to train two base-line models: one that converts game states into fictional narrative descriptions and another that predicts game states from fiction. These models demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset for tasks involving the mapping between stories and playable text adventure games. We make the dataset, the trained models, and a Python game engine publicly available to facilitate further research."
