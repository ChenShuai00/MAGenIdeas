    "title": "An AI Dungeon Master's Guide: Learning to Converse and Guide with Intents and Theory-of-Mind in Dungeons and Dragons",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel task, G ANDALF (Generating Guidance in Goal-Driven Communication for Students), for studying goal-driven and grounded natural language interactions. Speci\ufb01cally, we choose Dungeons and Drag-ons (D&D)\u2014a role-playing game consisting of multiple player characters and a Dungeon Master (DM) who collaborate to achieve a set of goals that are bene\ufb01cial to the players\u2014as a testbed for this task. Here, each of the player characters is a student, with their own personas and abilities, and the DM is the teacher, an ar-bitrator of the rules of the world and responsible for assisting and guiding the students towards a global goal. We propose a theory-of-mind-inspired methodology for training such a DM model to generate guidance for students with reinforcement learning (RL), where a DM: (1) learns to predict how the players will react to its utterances using a dataset of D&D dialogue transcripts; and (2) uses this prediction as a reward function providing feed-back on how effective these utterances are at guiding the players towards a goal. Human and automated evaluations show that a DM trained with RL to generate guidance by incorporating a theory-of-mind of the players significantly improves the players\u2019 ability to achieve goals grounded in their shared world."
