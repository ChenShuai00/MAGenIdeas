    "title": "Layout-Aware Neural Model for Resolving Hierarchical Table Structure",
    "abstract": "While many pipelines for extracting informa- 001 tion from tables assume simple table structure, 002 tables in the financial domain frequently have 003 complex, hierarchical structure. The main ex- 004 ample would be parent-child relationships be- 005 tween header cells. Most prior datasets of ta- 006 bles annotated from images or .pdf and most 007 models for extracting table structure concen- 008 trate on the problems of table, cell, row, and 009 column bounding box extraction. The area of 010 fine-grained table structure remains relatively 011 unexplored. In this study, we present a dataset 012 of 887 tables, manually labeled for cell types 013 and column hierarchy relations. The tables are 014 selected from IBM FinTabNet, a much larger 015 dataset of more than 100,000 financial tables 016 having cell, row, and column bounding boxes 017 extracted by deep learning, but not including 018 semantic cell type or cell-to-cell relation la- 019 bels, which we add. Selection of these 887 020 tables is performed using heuristics which re- 021 sult in a much larger proportion, roughly half, 022 of the selected tables having complex hierar- 023 chical structure, than a random sample from 024 FinTabNet. Further, we fine-tune models based 025 on LayoutLM on the cell-type classification 026 task and on the identification of hiearchical re- 027 lations among column headers. We achieve F1 028 scores of 95% and 70% on the respective tasks. 029 Finally, we use the trained model to create soft 030 labels for the entirety of FinTabNet. 031"
