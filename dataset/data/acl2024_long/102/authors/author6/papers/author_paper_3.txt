    "abstract": "Optical neural architectures (ONAs) use coding elements with optimized physical parameters to perform intelligent measurements. However, fabricating ONAs while maintaining design performances is challenging. Limitations in fabrication techniques often limit the realizable precision of the trained parameters. Physical constraints may also limit the range of values the physical parameters can hold. Thus, ONAs should be trained within the implementable constraints. However, such physics-based constraints reduce the training objective to a constrained optimization problem, making it harder to optimize with existing gradient-based methods. To alleviate these critical issues \u2013 that degrade performance from simulation to realization\u2013 we propose a physics-informed quantization-aware training framework. Our approach accounts for the physical constraints during the training process, leading to robust designs. We evaluate our approach on an ONA proposed in the literature, named a diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), for all-optical phase imaging and for classification of phase objects. With extensive experiments on different quantization levels and datasets, we show that our approach leads to ONA designs that are robust to quantization noise."
