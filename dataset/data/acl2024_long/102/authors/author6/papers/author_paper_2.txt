    "abstract": "With applications ranging from metabolomics to histopathology, quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) is a powerful label-free imaging modality. Despite significant advances in fast multiplexed imaging sensors and deep-learning-based inverse solvers, the throughput of QPM is currently limited by the pixel-rate of the image sensors. Complementarily, to improve throughput further, here we propose to acquire images in a compressed form so that more information can be transferred beyond the existing hardware bottleneck of the image sensor. To this end, we present a numerical simulation of a learnable optical compression-decompression framework that learns content-specific features. The proposed differentiable quantitative phase microscopy (\u2202-QPM) first uses learnable optical processors as image compressors. The intensity representations produced by these optical processors are then captured by the imaging sensor. Finally, a reconstruction network running on a computer decompresses the QPM images post aquisition. In numerical experiments, the proposed system achieves compression of \u00d7 64 while maintaining the SSIM of \u223c0.90 and PSNR of \u223c30 dB on cells. The results demonstrated by our experiments open up a new pathway to QPM systems that may provide unprecedented throughput improvements."
