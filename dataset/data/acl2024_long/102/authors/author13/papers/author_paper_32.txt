    "title": "Evaluating Inclusivity, Equity, and Accessibility of NLP Technology: A Case Study for Indian Languages",
    "abstract": "In order for NLP technology to be widely ap- 001 plicable and useful, it needs to be inclusive 002 of users across the world\u2019s languages, equi- 003 table , i.e., not unduly biased towards any par- 004 ticular language, and accessible to users, par- 005 ticularly in low-resource settings where com- 006 pute constraints are common. In this paper, we 007 propose an evaluation paradigm that assesses 008 NLP technologies across all three dimensions, 009 hence quantifying the diversity of users they 010 can serve. While inclusion and accessibility 011 have received attention in recent literature, eq- 012 uity is currently unexplored. We propose to 013 address this gap using the Gini coef\ufb01cient, a 014 well-established metric used for estimating so- 015 cietal wealth inequality. Using our paradigm, 016 we highlight the distressed state of diversity of 017 current technologies for Indian (IN) languages. 018 Our focus on IN is motivated by their linguistic 019 diversity and their large, varied speaker pop- 020 ulation. To improve upon these metrics, we 021 demonstrate the importance of region-speci\ufb01c 022 choices in model building and dataset creation 023 and also propose a novel approach to optimal 024 resource allocation during \ufb01ne-tuning. Finally, 025 we discuss steps that must be taken to mitigate 026 these biases and call upon the community to in- 027 corporate our evaluation paradigm when build- 028 ing linguistically diverse technologies."
