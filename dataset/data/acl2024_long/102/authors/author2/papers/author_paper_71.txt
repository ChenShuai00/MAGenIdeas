    "title": "Application of high-level synthesis in an industrial project",
    "abstract": "This paper describes the use of high-level synthesis in conjunction with logic synthesis for designing an industrial product specified at system-level in behavioral VHDL and realized in FPGAs. The designers' experiences from using the high-level synthesis tool and its interaction with the other tools are analyzed. Important problems were the handling of precise timing constraints and feedback of adequate technology information to the high-level synthesis.<<ETX>>"
