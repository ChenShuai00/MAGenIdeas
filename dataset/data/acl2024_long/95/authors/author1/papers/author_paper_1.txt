    "title": "FIRST: Teach A Reliable Large Language Model Through Efficient Trustworthy Distillation",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, leading to an expectation for LLMs to be trustworthy \u2014- both accurate and well-calibrated (the prediction confidence should align with its ground truth correctness likelihood). Nowadays, fine-tuning has become the most popular method for adapting a model to practical usage by significantly increasing accuracy on downstream tasks. Despite the great accuracy it achieves, we found fine-tuning is still far away from satisfactory trustworthiness due to \u201ctuning-induced mis-calibration\u201d. In this paper, we delve deeply into why and how mis-calibration exists in fine-tuned models, and how distillation can alleviate the issue. Then we further propose a brand new method named Efficient Trustworthy Distillation (FIRST), which utilizes a small portion of teacher\u2019s knowledge to obtain a reliable language model in a cost-efficient way. Specifically, we identify the \u201cconcentrated knowledge\u201d phenomenon during distillation, which can significantly reduce the computational burden. Then we apply a \u201ctrustworthy maximization\u201d process to optimize the utilization of this small portion of concentrated knowledge before transferring it to the student. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where better accuracy (+2.3%) and less mis-calibration (-10%) are achieved on average across both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, indicating better trustworthiness."
