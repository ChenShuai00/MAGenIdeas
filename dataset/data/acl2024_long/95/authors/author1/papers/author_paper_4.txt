    "title": "Language-driven Object Fusion into Neural Radiance Fields with Pose-Conditioned Dataset Updates",
    "abstract": "Neural radiance field (NeRF) is an emerging technique for 3D scene reconstruction and modeling. However, current NeRF-based methods are limited in the capabilities of adding or removing objects. This paper fills the aforementioned gap by proposing a new language-driven method for object manipulation in NeRFs through dataset updates. Specifically, to insert an object represented by a set of multi-view images into a background NeRF, we use a text-to-image diffusion model to blend the object into the given background across views. The generated images are then used to update the NeRF so that we can render view-consistent images of the object within the background. To ensure view consistency, we propose a dataset update strategy that prioritizes the radiance field training based on camera poses in a pose-ordered manner. We validate our method in two case studies: object insertion and object removal. Experimental results show that our method can generate photo-realistic results and achieves state-of-the-art performance in NeRF editing."
