    "title": "Subobject-level Image Tokenization",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based vision models typically tokenize images into fixed-size square patches as input units, which lacks the adaptability to image content and overlooks the inherent pixel grouping structure. Inspired by the subword tokenization widely adopted in language models, we propose an image tokenizer at a subobject level, where the subobjects are represented by semantically meaningful image segments obtained by segmentation models (e.g., segment anything models). To implement a learning system based on subobject tokenization, we first introduced a Direct Segment Anything Model (DirectSAM) that efficiently produces comprehensive segmentation of subobjects, then embed subobjects into compact latent vectors and fed them into a large language model for vision language learning. Empirical results demonstrated that our subobject-level tokenization significantly facilitates efficient learning of translating images into object and attribute descriptions compared to the traditional patch-level tokenization. Codes and models are open-sourced at https://github.com/ChenDelong1999/subobjects."
