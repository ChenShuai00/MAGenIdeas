    "title": "Prompting DirectSAM for Semantic Contour Extraction in Remote Sensing Images",
    "abstract": "The Direct Segment Anything Model (DirectSAM) excels in class-agnostic contour extraction. In this paper, we explore its use by applying it to optical remote sensing imagery, where semantic contour extraction-such as identifying buildings, road networks, and coastlines-holds significant practical value. Those applications are currently handled via training specialized small models separately on small datasets in each domain. We introduce a foundation model derived from DirectSAM, termed DirectSAM-RS, which not only inherits the strong segmentation capability acquired from natural images, but also benefits from a large-scale dataset we created for remote sensing semantic contour extraction. This dataset comprises over 34k image-text-contour triplets, making it at least 30 times larger than individual dataset. DirectSAM-RS integrates a prompter module: a text encoder and cross-attention layers attached to the DirectSAM architecture, which allows flexible conditioning on target class labels or referring expressions. We evaluate the DirectSAM-RS in both zero-shot and fine-tuning setting, and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across several downstream benchmarks."
