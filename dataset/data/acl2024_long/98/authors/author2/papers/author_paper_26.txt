    "abstract": "This paper describes our system that has been submitted to SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection. We focus on removing the noise inherent in the hyperpartisanship dataset from both data-level and model-level by leveraging semi-supervised pseudo-labels and the state-of-the-art BERT model. Our model achieves 75.8% accuracy in the final by-article dataset without ensemble learning."
