    "title": "Exploring LLMs for Personal Knowledge Graph Population from Conversation",
    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have 001 made significant advancements, they still lack 002 the ability to personalize responses. However, 003 manually inputting personal information into 004 LLMs can be tedious and may never be com-005 pleted. Since conversations contain a wealth 006 of personal information, we propose to ex-007 tract personal information and populate a per-008 sonal knowledge graph (PKG) from conversa-009 tion. We explored finetuning and prompting 010 LLMs, but found that they still struggle with 011 generating desired PKGs. Our analysis shows 012 that GPT-3.5 cannot generate knowledge triples 013 with desired relations and T5 often fails to iden-014 tify the correct subject. Furthermore, GPT-3.5 015 struggles with extracting in-context subjects, 016 recognizing negation expressions, and differen-017 tiating between questions and statements. By 018 highlighting these limitations, we aim to inspire 019 future research on PKG population from con-020 versation and the development of personalized 021 dialogue systems. 022"
