    "title": "Word Embedding Calculus in Meaningful Ultradense Subspaces",
    "abstract": "We decompose a standard embedding space into interpretable orthogonal sub-spaces and a \u201cremainder\u201d subspace. We consider four interpretable subspaces in this paper: polarity, concreteness, frequency and part-of-speech (POS) sub-spaces. We introduce a new calculus for subspaces that supports operations like \u201c \u2212 1 \u00d7 hate = love \u201d and \u201cgive me a neutral word for greasy \u201d (i.e., oleaginous ). This calculus extends analogy computations like \u201c king \u2212 man + woman = queen \u201d. For the tasks of Antonym Classi\ufb01cation and POS Tagging our method outperforms the state of the art. We create test sets for Morphological Analogies and for the new task of Polarity Spectrum Creation."
