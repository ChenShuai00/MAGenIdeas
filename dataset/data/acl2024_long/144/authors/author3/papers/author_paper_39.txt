    "title": "Tight Coupling of Character, Word, and Place Recognition for End-to-End Text Recognition in Maps",
    "abstract": "Text recognition in maps is a special case of general text recognition that features some especially dif\ufb01cult challenges, including texts at extreme orientations, wide character spacings, complex text-like distractors, and unusual non-dictionary strings. Off-the-shelf OCR systems, and even sophisticated scene text recognition systems do not work satisfactorily on many map-text recognition problems. While many OCR and scene text systems have produced high quality results by considering detection, recognition, and error-correction as separate components, we believe that map text recognition can bene\ufb01t immensely from the tight coupling of different components of an overall sys-tem. In particular, we present an end-to-end system for recognizing text in maps that uses strong coupling in two different ways. In the \ufb01rst, we train individual character detectors, and use these detections as inputs in a new word detection CNN architecture to improve word detection. We show dramatic increases in word detection accuracy for a strong baseline detection architecture. In the second contribution, we use a geographically-based lexicon to constrain our interpretations of initial detections. If the lexicon suggests that the word detection is either too short, we \u201cre-prime\u201d the word detector by inserting expected characters locations back into the word detector using a novel input mechanism. We then rerun the word detector using the additional character suggestions, giving a solid improvement in accuracy. We report end-to-end recognition results on a public map-text recognition benchmark."
