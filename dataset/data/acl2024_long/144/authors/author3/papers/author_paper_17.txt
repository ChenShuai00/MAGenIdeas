    "title": "GSplit: Scaling Graph Neural Network Training on Large Graphs via Split-Parallelism",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs), an emerging class of machine learning models for graphs, have gained popularity for their superior performance in various graph analytical tasks. Mini-batch training is commonly used to train GNNs on large graphs, and data parallelism is the standard approach to scale mini-batch training across multiple GPUs. One of the major performance costs in GNN training is the loading of input features, which prevents GPUs from being fully utilized. In this paper, we argue that this problem is exacerbated by redundancies that are inherent to the data parallel approach. To address this issue, we introduce a hybrid parallel mini-batch training paradigm called split parallelism. Split parallelism avoids redundant data loads and splits the sampling and training of each mini-batch across multiple GPUs online, at each iteration, using a lightweight splitting algorithm. We implement split parallelism in GSplit and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art mini-batch training systems like DGL, Quiver, and $P^3$."
