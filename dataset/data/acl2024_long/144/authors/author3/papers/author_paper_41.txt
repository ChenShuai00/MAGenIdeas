    "title": "Towards Quicker Probabilistic Recognition with Multiple Goal Heuristic Search",
    "abstract": "Referred to as an approach for either plan or goal recognition, the original method proposed by Ram\u00b4\u0131rez and Geffner introduced a domain-based approach that did not need a library containing speci\ufb01c plan instances. This introduced a more generalizable means of representing tasks to be recognized, but was also very slow due to its need to run simulations via multiple executions of an off-the-shelf classical planner. Several variations have since been proposed for quicker recognition, but each one uses a drastically different approach that must sacri\ufb01ce other qualities useful for processing the recognition results in more complex systems. We present work in progress that takes advantage of the shared state space be-tween planner executions to perform multiple goal heuristic search. This single execution of a planner will potentially speed up the recognition process using the original method, which also maintains the sacri\ufb01ced properties and improves some of the assumptions made by Ram\u00b4\u0131rez and Geffner."
