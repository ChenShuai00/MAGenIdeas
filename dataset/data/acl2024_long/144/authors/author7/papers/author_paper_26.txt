    "title": "Code4Struct: Code Generation for Few-Shot Structured Prediction from Natural Language",
    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) trained on the mixture of text and code has demonstrated impressive capability in translating natural language (NL) into structured code. In this work, we propose C ODE 4S TRUCT to leverage such text-to-structure translation capability to tackle structured prediction tasks in NLP. For example, Event Argument Extraction (EAE) aims to convert text into event-argument structures that can be represented as a class object using code. This alignment between structures and code enables us to take advantage of Programming Language (PL) features such as inheritance 1 and type annotation 2 to introduce external knowledge or add constraints with ease. We exploit the analogy between PL and NLP problems, and, as a case study, we use C ODE 4S TRUCT to tackle the EAE task us-ing code generation. We ask a LLM to generate code to instantiate an event class with predicted arguments given a NL sentence. Despite only using 50 training instances for each event type, C ODE 4S TRUCT is comparable to fully-supervised models trained on 4,202 event instances and, when given the same 50-shot data, outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 20.8% absolute F1. When prompted with hierarchical event types implemented using inheritance, C ODE 4S TRUCT can predict arguments for low-resource event types using 10-shot training instances from its sibling event type and outperforms zero-shot baseline by 12% absolute F1. 3"
