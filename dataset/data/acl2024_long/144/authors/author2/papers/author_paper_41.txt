    "abstract": "For \ufb01ne-grained entity extraction, we propose a \ufb01ne-grained entity typing model with a novel attention mechanism and a hybrid type classi-\ufb01er. We advance existing methods in two aspects: feature extraction and type prediction. To capture richer contextual information, we adopt contextualized word representations instead of \ufb01xed word embeddings used in previous work. In addition, we propose a two-step mention-aware attention mechanism to enable the model to focus on important words in mentions and contexts. We also develop a hybrid classi\ufb01cation method beyond binary relevance to exploit type interdependency with latent type representation. Instead of independently predicting each type, we predict a low-dimensional vector that encodes latent type features and reconstruct the type vector from this latent representation."
