    "title": "Multi-SQL: An extensible multi-model data query language",
    "abstract": "Big data management aims to establish data hubs that support data in multiple models and types in an all-around way. Thus, the multi-model database system is a promising architecture for building such a multi-model data store. For an integrated data hub, a unified and flexible query language is incredibly necessary. In this paper, an extensible and practical query language--Multi-SQL is proposed to realize the unified management of multi-model data considering the co-processing of multi-model data. To the best of our knowledge, Multi-SQL is the first query language based on various data models. We take four popular data models, i.e., RELATION, GRAPH, KV, DOCUMENT, as the foundation of Multi-SQL design. Multi-SQL can also be expanded to suit more complicated scenarios as it is flexible to add other data models. Moreover, we provide a formal semantic definition of the core features of Multi-SQL and propose an effective algorithm based on equivalence class rule (ECT) to process multi-query. Compared with some existing popular databases' query languages, experimental results demonstrate that Multi-SQL is remarkable in the case of complex multi-queries."
