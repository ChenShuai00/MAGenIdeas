    "title": "On the Value of Behavioral Representations for Dense Retrieval",
    "abstract": "We consider text retrieval within dense representational space in real-world settings such as e-commerce search where (a) document popularity and (b) diversity of queries associated with a document have a skewed distribution. Most of contemporary dense retrieval literature\u2013which typically focuses on MSMARCO and TREC bench-mark datasets\u2013present two shortcomings in these settings. (1) They learn an almost equal number of representations per document , agnostic to the fact that a few \u2018head\u2019 documents are disproportionately more critical to achieving a good retrieval performance. (ii) They learn purely semantic document representations inferred from intrinsic document characteristics (e.g. tokenized text) which may not contain adequate information to determine the queries for which the document is relevant\u2013especially when the document is short. We propose to overcome these limitations by augmenting seman- tic document representations learned by bi-encoders with behavioral document representations learned by our proposed approach MVG. To do so, MVG (1) determines how to divide the total budget for behavioral representations by drawing a connection to Pitman-Yor process, and (2) simply clusters the queries related to a given document (based on user behavior) within the representational space learned by a base bi-encoder, and treats the cluster centers as its behavioral representations. Our central contribution is the finding such a simple intuitive light-weight approach leads to substantial gains in key first-stage retrieval metrics (e.g. recall) . We comparing to single-vector (e.g. and multi-vector (e.g."
