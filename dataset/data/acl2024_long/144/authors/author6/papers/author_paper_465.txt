    "title": "Scalable logical coordinates framework for routing in wireless sensor networks",
    "abstract": "In this article, we present logical coordinates based routing (LCR), a novel framework for scalable and location-independent routing in wireless sensor networks. LCR assigns each node a logical coordinate vector, and routes packets following these vectors. We demonstrate that LCR (i) guarantees packet delivery with a high probability, (ii) finds good paths, and (iii) exhibits robust performance in the presence of network voids and node failures. We systematically evaluate the performance of LCR through simulations and compare it with other state-of-the-art protocols. We also propose two extensions of LCR, one for three-dimensional node deployments and the other for unreliable wireless links."
