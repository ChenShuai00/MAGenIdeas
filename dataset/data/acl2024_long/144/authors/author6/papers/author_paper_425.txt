    "abstract": "Sensor networks introduce a new application domain and set of challenges in distributed computing including new network-level programming languages, global system abstractions, and general-purpose communication protocols. These challenges are brought about by the tight integration of computation, communication, and distributed real-time interaction with the physical world. With the growing interest in interconnecting different sensor networks across a wide-area communication infrastructure, an overarching challenge becomes one of arriving at an agreed-upon global sensor network architecture that ensures interoperability. Unlike the Internet, where a layered communication stack (namely, the TCP/IP stack) defines the network architecture, a sensor network architecture must unify not only communication interfaces but also programming interfaces, since network communication and computation functions are tightly intertwined. In that sense, the sensor network architecture refers to a layered stack of distributed computing abstractions. This paper presents an architecture and key considerations in designing and interconnecting local and global sensor networks. Candidate protocols and middleware instantiations are described from the authors' ongoing work that meet the discussed considerations"
