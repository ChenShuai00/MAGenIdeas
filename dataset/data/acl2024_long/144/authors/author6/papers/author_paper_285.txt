    "title": "IntruMine: Mining Intruders in Untrustworthy Data of Cyber-physical Systems",
    "abstract": "A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical (i.e., sensor) devices with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a situation-aware system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in real-world. It has wide application to scenarios of traffic control, environment monitoring and battlefield surveillance. This study investigates the specific problem of intruder mining in CPS: With a large number of sensors deployed in a designated area, the task is real time detection of intruders who enter the area, based on untrustworthy data. We propose a method called IntruMine to detect and verify the intruders. IntruMine constructs monitoring graphs to model the relationships between sensors and possible intruders, and computes the position and energy of each intruder with the link information from these monitoring graphs. Finally, a confidence rating is calculated for each potential detection, reducing false positives in the results. IntruMine is a generalized approach. Two classical methods of intruder detection can be seen as special cases of IntruMine under certain conditions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of IntruMine on both synthetic and real datasets and the experimental results show that IntruMine has better effectiveness and efficiency than existing methods."
