    "title": "Energy-conserving data placement and asynchronous multicast in wireless sensor networks",
    "abstract": "In recent years, large distributed sensor networks have emerged as a new fast-growing application domain for wireless computing. In this paper, we present a distributed application-layer service for data placement and asynchronous multicast whose purpose is power conservation. Since the dominant traffic in a sensor network is that of data retrieval, (i) caching mutable data at locations that minimize the sum of request and update traffic, and (ii) asynchronously multicasting updates from sensors to observers can significantly reduce the total number of packet transmissions in the network. Our simulation results show that our service subsequently reduces network energy consumption while maintaining the desired data consistency semantics."
