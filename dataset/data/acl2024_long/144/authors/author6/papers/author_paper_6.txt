    "title": "MOSAIC: Spatially-Multiplexed Edge AI Optimization over Multiple Concurrent Video Sensing Streams",
    "abstract": "Sustaining high fidelity and high throughput of perception tasks over vision sensor streams on edge devices remains a formidable challenge, especially given the continuing increase in image sizes (e.g., generated by 4K cameras) and complexity of DNN models. One promising approach involves criticality-aware processing, where the computation is directed selectively to \"critical\" portions of individual image frames. We introduce MOSAIC, a novel system for such criticality-aware concurrent processing of multiple vision sensing streams that provides a multiplicative increase in the achievable throughput with negligible loss in perception fidelity. MOSAIC determines critical regions from images received from multiple vision sensors and spatially bin-packs these regions using a novel multi-scale Mosaic Across Scales (MoS) tiling strategy into a single `canvas frame', sized such that the edge device can retain sufficiently high processing throughput. Experimental studies using benchmark datasets for two tasks, Automatic License Plate Recognition and Drone-based Pedestrian Detection, shows that MOSAIC, executing on a Jetson TX2 edge device, can provide dramatic gains in the throughput vs. fidelity tradeoff. For instance, for drone-based pedestrian detection, for a batch size of 4, MOSAIC can pack input frames from 6 cameras to achieve (a) 4.75X (475%) higher throughput (23 FPS per camera, cumulatively 138FPS) with \u2264 1% accuracy loss, compared to a First Come First Serve (FCFS) processing paradigm."
