    "title": "A Control Theory Approach to Throughput Optimization in Multi-Channel Collection Sensor Networks",
    "abstract": "Most currently deployed sensor networks use the same channel to communicate information among nodes. This is a source of great inefficiency as it poorly utilizes the available wireless spectrum. This paper takes advantage of radio capabilities of MicaZ motes that can communicate on multiple frequencies as specified in the 802.15.4 standard. We consider the case of a data collection sensor network where multiple base-stations are responsible for draining data from sensor nodes. A key question becomes how to assign nodes to wireless channels such that network throughput is maximized. The problem is reduced to one of load balancing. A control theoretical approach is used to design a self-regulating load-balancing algorithm that maximizes total network throughput. It is evaluated both in simulation and on an experimental testbed. The results demonstrate a significant performance improvement. It is shown that a control theory approach is indeed needed to guarantee stability in data collection networks and prevent undue oscillation of nodes among different wireless channels upon dynamic changes in load conditions."
