    "title": "Unsupervised Belief Representation Learning in Polarized Networks with Information-Theoretic Variational Graph Auto-Encoders",
    "abstract": "This paper develops a novel unsupervised algorithm for belief representation learning in polarized networks that (i) uncovers the latent dimensions of the underlying belief space and (ii) jointly embeds users and content items (that they interact with) into that space in a manner that facilitates a number of downstream tasks, such as stance detection, stance prediction, and ideology mapping. Inspired by total correlation in information theory, we propose a novel Information-Theoretic Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (In-foVGAE) that learns to project both users and content items (e.g., posts that represent user views) into an appropriate disentangled latent space. In order to better disentangle orthogonal latent variables in that space, we develop total correlation regularization, PI control module, and adopt rectified Gaussian Distribution for the latent space. The latent representation of users and content can then be used to quantify their ideological leaning and detect/predict their stances on issues. We evaluate the performance of the proposed InfoVGAE on three real-world datasets, of which two are collected from Twitter and one from U.S. Congress voting records. The evaluation results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised models and produce comparable result with supervised models. We also discuss stance prediction and user ranking within ideological groups. The code and datasets are available at https://github."
