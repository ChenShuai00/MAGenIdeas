    "abstract": "It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 12th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN 2013). The symposium continues its tradition of excellence with a vibrant program this year that combines the Information Processing (IP) and the Sensor Platforms (SPOTS) tracks. The goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia to address the gamut of challenges from theoretical foundations of information processing in sensor networks to new hardware architecture and platform prototypes. I sincerely thank the program chairs Kay Romer and Raj Rajkumar for putting together this exciting program. We owe the quality of this year's symposium to their dedicated efforts. \n \nBeing part of CPSWeek, a landmark multidisciplinary event in the area of cyber-physical systems, IPSN is colocated with four related conferences (namely, HSCC, ICCPS, HiCONS, and RTAS), and a significant number of workshops and tutorials. I sincerely thank the organizers of CPSWeek for working together with IPSN and the other conferences and workshops on ironing out all the challenging coordination details and making the coordinated event a success. CPSWeek also features three exciting keynotes: \"Sensemaking for Mobile Health\" by Deborah Estrin, \"Aerial Robot Swarms\" by Vijay Kumar, and \"Challenges in Modeling Cyber-physical Systems\" by Manfred Broy. \n \nIn addition to keynote and paper presentations, IPSN features a poster and demonstration session. Special thanks goes to Luca Mottola, the Demo Chair, and Tian He, the Poster Chair, for organizing it. A Ph.D. forum is also held to offer Ph.D. students a chance to present their dissertation research and to get advice on thesis directions. Thanks to Polly Huang for putting that forum together."
