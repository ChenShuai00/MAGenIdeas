    "title": "Keynote Speech: Sensor Network Control Challenges",
    "abstract": "Sensor networks open significant challenges in distributed computing that pertain to the specification and control of aggregate network behavior. While significant efforts have gone into developing abstractions and high-level programming paradigms for specifying sensor network behavior on a macroscopic scale, models and algorithms for control of such behavior have not yet been adequately explored. This talk presents some of the current directions in sensor network macro-programming and protocol design, as well as challenges in achieving the desired aggregate behavior in the context of such protocols and abstractions. These challenges are interpreted from a control perspective yielding preliminary examples of applying a control-theoretic approach to sensor network software development. He has authored/coauthored three book chapters and more than 80 refereed publications in leading conferences and journals in several fields including real-time computing, distributed systems, sensor networks, and control. He is Review. He served on numerous technical program committees in real-time computing, networking , quality of service, distributed systems, sensor networks, multimedia, and mobile computing, among others. He also held several conference organization positions including General Chair of RTSS 2007. Abdelzaher's research interests lie broadly in understanding and controlling the temporal properties of software systems in the face of increasing complexity, distribution , and degree of embedding in an external physical environment. Tarek Abdelzaher is a member of IEEE and ACM."
