    "abstract": "In this article we present SmartRoad, a crowd-sourced road sensing system that detects and identifies traffic regulators, traffic lights, and stop signs, in particular. As an alternative to expensive road surveys, SmartRoad works on participatory sensing data collected from GPS sensors from in-vehicle smartphones. The resulting traffic regulator information can be used for many assisted-driving or navigation systems. In order to achieve accurate detection and identification under realistic and practical settings, SmartRoad automatically adapts to different application requirements by (i) intelligently choosing the most appropriate information representation and transmission schemes, and (ii) dynamically evolving its core detection and identification engines to effectively take advantage of any external ground truth information or manual label opportunity. We implemented SmartRoad on a vehicular smartphone test bed, and deployed it on 35 external volunteer users\u2019 vehicles for two months. Experiment results show that SmartRoad can robustly, effectively, and efficiently carry out the detection and identification tasks."
