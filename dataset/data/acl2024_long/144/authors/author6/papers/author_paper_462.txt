    "title": "Achieving Repeatability of Asynchronous Events in Wireless Sensor Networks with EnviroLog",
    "abstract": "Abstract : Sensing events from dynamic environments are normally asynchronous and non-repeatable. This lack of repeatability makes it particularly difficult to statistically evaluate the performance of sensor network applications. Hence, it is essential to have the capability to capture and replay sensing events, providing a basis not only for system evaluation, but also for realistic protocol comparison and parameter tuning. To achieve that, we design and implement EnviroLog, a distributed service that improves repeatability of experimental testing of sensor networks via asynchronous event recording and replay. To use EnviroLog, an application programmer needs only to specify two types of simple annotations to the source code. Automatically, the preprocessor embeds EnviroLog into any desired level of an event-driven architecture. It records all events generated by lower layers and can replay them later to upper layers on demand. We validate the accuracy and performance of recording and replay through a set of microbenchmarks, using the latest XSM platforms. We further demonstrate the strength of EnviroLog in system tuning and performance evaluation for sensor network applications in an outdoor environment with 37 XSMs."
