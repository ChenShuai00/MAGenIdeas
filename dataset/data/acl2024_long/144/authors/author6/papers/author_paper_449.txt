    "title": "MMSN: Multi-Frequency Media Access Control for Wireless Sensor Networks",
    "abstract": "Multi-frequency media access control has been well understood in general wireless ad hoc networks, while in wireless sensor networks, researchers still focus on single frequency solutions. In wireless sensor networks, each device is typically equipped with a single radio transceiver and applications adopt much smaller packet sizes compared to those in general wireless ad hoc networks. Hence, the multi-frequency MAC protocols proposed for general wireless ad hoc networks are not suitable for wireless sensor network applications, which we further demonstrate through our simulation experiments. In this paper, we propose MMSN, which takes advantage of multi-frequency availability while, at the same time, takes into account the restrictions in wireless sensor networks. In MMSN, four frequency assignment options are provided to meet different application requirements. A scalable media access is designed with efficient broadcast support. Also, an optimal non-uniform backoff algorithm is derived and its lightweight approximation is implemented in MMSN, which significantly reduces congestion in the time synchronized media access design. Through extensive experiments, MMSN exhibits prominent ability to utilize parallel transmission among neighboring nodes. It also achieves increased energy efficiency when multiple physical frequencies are available."
