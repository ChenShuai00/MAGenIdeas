    "title": "SmartRoad: A Mobile Phone Based Crowd-Sourced Road Sensing System",
    "abstract": "In this paper we describe SmartRoad, a road sensing system that generates and collects mobile sensory data from vehicle-resident mobile phones, in enabling and supporting crowd-sourced road sensing applications and services, as an alternative to expensive road surveys conducted traditionally. We implement the SmartRoad prototype system, and deploy it on 35 volunteer users\u2019 vehicles for 2 months, collecting about 4,000 miles of driving data."
