    "abstract": "Welcome to SenSys'08, the Sixth ACM International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems! We have what promises to be an exciting technical program, highlighted by 25 excellent technical papers, two interesting workshops, and a lively demo and poster session. Continuing last year's innovation, we will also have a special session of \"soap box\" talks, for expressing strong, controversial and/or outrageous opinions on a topic within the scope of SenSys. There will be a best paper award, a best talk award, and several best demo awards (in different categories). These will be announced at the conference. \n \nThe 25 technical papers were selected from 153 completed paper submissions. Submissions were received from authors coming from 33 countries. Each submitted paper was reviewed by at least three PC experts in the first round of reviewing, around 75 papers got at least one more review in the second round. Most of these reviews were done by the program committee themselves, but where some papers required specific additional skills or knowledge, reviews were delegated to external experts as well. In July we held a two-day-long face-to-face discussion of the PC members in Chicago. All paper reviews and PC discussions were double-blind, preserving both author and reviewer anonymity. Ultimately, 25 papers were selected for the final program. Each of these accepted papers was carefully shepherded by a TPC member to ensure that all important reviewer comments were addressed."
