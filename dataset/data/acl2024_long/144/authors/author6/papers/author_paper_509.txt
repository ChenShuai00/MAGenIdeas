    "title": "Partitioned aperiodic scheduling on multiprocessors",
    "abstract": "This paper studies multiprocessor scheduling for aperiodic tasks where future arrivals are unknown. We propose an algorithm for tasks without migration capabilities and prove that it has a capacity bound of 0.31. No algorithm for tasks without migration capabilities can have a capacity bound greater than 0.50."
