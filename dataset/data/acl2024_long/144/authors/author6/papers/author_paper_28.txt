    "title": "ComAI: Enabling Lightweight, Collaborative Intelligence by Retrofitting Vision DNNs",
    "abstract": "While Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have transformed machine vision capabilities, their extremely high computational complexity and model sizes present a formidable deployment roadblock for AIoT applications. We show that the complexity-vs-accuracy-vs-communication tradeoffs for such DNN models can be significantly addressed via a novel, lightweight form of \"collaborative machine intelligence\" that requires only runtime changes to the inference process. In our proposed approach, called ComAI, the DNN pipelines of different vision sensors share intermediate processing state with one another, effectively providing hints about objects located within their mutually-overlapping Field-of-Views (FoVs). CoMAI uses two novel techniques: (a) a secondary shallow ML model that uses features from early layers of a peer DNN to predict object confidence values in the image, and (b) a pipelined sharing of such confidence values, by collaborators, that is then used to bias a reference DNN\u2019s outputs. We demonstrate that CoMAI (a) can boost accuracy (recall) of DNN inference by 20-50%, (b) works across heterogeneous DNN models and deployments, and (c) incurs negligible processing, bandwidth and processing overheads compared to non-collaborative baselines."
