    "title": "EnviroStore: A Cooperative Storage System for Disconnected Operation in Sensor Networks",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a new cooperative storage system for sensor networks geared for disconnected operation (where sensor nodes do not have a connected path to a basestation). The goal of the system is to maximize its data storage capacity by appropriately distributing storage utilization and opportunistically offloading data to external devices when possible. The system is motivated by the observation that a large category of sensor network applications, such as environmental data logging, does not require real-time data access. Such networks generally operate in a disconnected mode. Rather than focusing on multihop routing to a basestation, an important concern becomes (i) to maximize the effective storage capacity of the disconnected sensor network such that it accommodates the most data, and (ii) to take the best advantage of data upload opportunities when they become available to relieve network storage. The storage system described in this paper achieves the above goals, leading to significant improvements in the amount of data collected compared to non-cooperative storage. It is implemented in nesC for TinyOS and evaluated in TOSSIM through various application scenarios."
