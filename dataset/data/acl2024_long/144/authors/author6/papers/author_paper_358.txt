    "abstract": "It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 9th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN 2010). We hope you enjoy this conference that attracts a diverse set of attendees from both academia and industry and is a leading venue for publications and idea exchange on sensor networks. IPSN is unique in its broad coverage of the field, ranging from analytic foundations to system implementation and platforms. It is a meeting point of theory and practice embodied in its two tracks; Information Processing (IP) and Sensor Platforms, Tools and Design Methods (SPOTS). \n \nThe field of sensor networks has seen a significant expansion and maturation over the years. In evidence of such growth, IPSN 2010 received an impressive number of high quality contributions, totaling 58 in the SPOTS track and 117 in the IP track. These submissions underwent a very careful review process, each receiving at least 3 reviews and occasionally up to 5 reviews. The review phase was followed by an online discussion by the technical program committee, culminating in a technical program committee meeting. Only 31 papers were selected for publication of which 20 were in the IP track and 11 in the SPOTS track. All accepted papers were assigned shepherds to help further improve the quality of the final manuscripts."
