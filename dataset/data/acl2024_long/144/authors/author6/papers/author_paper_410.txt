    "title": "iPDA: An integrity-protecting private data aggregation scheme for wireless sensor networks",
    "abstract": "Data aggregation is an efficient mechanism widely used in wireless sensor networks (WSN) to collect statistics about data of interests. However, the shared-medium nature of communication makes the WSNs are vulnerable to eavesdropping and packet tampering/injection by adversaries. Hence, how to protect data privacy and data integrity are two major challenges for data aggregation in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we present iPDA- an integrity-protecting private data aggregation scheme. In iPDA, data privacy is achieved through data slicing and assembling technique; and data integrity is achieved through redundancy by constructing disjoint aggregation paths/trees to collect data of interests. In iPDA, the data integrity-protection and data privacy-preservation mechanisms work synergistically. We evaluate the performance of iPDA scheme in terms of communication overhead and data aggregation accuracy, comparing with a typical data aggregation scheme - TAG, where no integrity protection and privacy preservation is provided. Simulation results show that iPDA achieves the design goals while still maintains the efficiency of data aggregation."
