    "abstract": "In this paper we present a balanced data replication scheme that provides real-time latency bounds on content retrieval in content distribution networks. Many network applications have ever-increasing requirements on latency sensitive data services. Data replication services have been widely used as an important performance enhancement mechanism to reduce data access latency and throughput. We investigate the problem of provisioning an underlying balanced data replication service to provide a global latency bound on data retrieval in content distribution networks. The solution involves constructing an overlay network based on the given latency bound, and a mechanism to assign content objects to the network nodes so that the workload of all the network nodes is balanced. Our evaluation results drawn from detailed simulations show the efficacy of our load-balancing scheme in meeting the latency bound requirements with high confidence under heavy load"
