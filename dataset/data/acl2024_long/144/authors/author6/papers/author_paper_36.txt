    "title": "Self-Contrastive Learning based Semi-Supervised Radio Modulation Classification",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework that is new in being designed for automatic modulation classification (AMC). By carefully utilizing unlabeled signal data with a self-supervised contrastive-learning pre-training step, our framework achieves higher performance given smaller amounts of labeled data, thereby largely reducing the labeling burden of deep learning. We evaluate the performance of our semi-supervised framework on a public dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that our semi-supervised approach significantly outperforms supervised frameworks thereby substantially enhancing our ability to train deep neural networks for automatic modulation classification in a manner that leverages unlabeled data."
