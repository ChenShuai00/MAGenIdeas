    "title": "PRONET: Network trust assessment based on incomplete provenance",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a tool ProNet, that is used to obtain the network trust based on incomplete provenance. We consider a multihop scenario where a set of source nodes observe an event and disseminate their observations as an information item through a multihop path to the command center. Nodes are assumed to embed their provenance details on the information content. Received provenance may not be complete at the command center due to attackers dropping provenance or the unavailability of provenance. We design ProNet, a tool which is at the command center that acts on the received information item to determine the information trust, node-level trust and sequence-level trust. ProNet contains three steps. In the first step it reconstructs the complete provenance details of received information from the available provenance. In the second step it employs a data classification scheme to classify the data into a good and bad pool. In the third step it employs pattern mining on the reconstructed provenance of bad data pools to determine the frequently appearing node and node sequence. This frequent appearance will quantify the trust level of nodes and node sequence. Now an information quality/trust level of newly received information can be determined based on the occurrences of these node/sequence patterns on the provenance data. We provide a detailed analysis on false positive and false negatives."
