    "title": "AdapCode: Adaptive Network Coding for Code Updates in Wireless Sensor Networks",
    "abstract": "Code updates, such as those for debugging purposes, are frequent and expensive in the early development stages of wireless sensor network applications. We propose AdapCode, a reliable data dissemination protocol that uses adaptive network coding to reduce broadcast traffic in the process of code updates. Packets on every node are coded by linear combination and decoded by Gaussian elimination. The core idea in AdapCode is to adaptively change the coding scheme according to the link quality. Our evaluation shows that AdapCode uses up to 40% less packets than Deluge in large networks. In addition, AdapCode performs much better in terms of load balancing, which prolongs the system lifetime, and has a slightly shorter propagation delay. Finally, we show that network coding is doable on sensor networks in that (i) it imposes only a 3 byte header overhead, (ii) it is easy to find linearly independent packets, and (3) Gaussian elimination needs only 1 KB of memory."
