    "title": "Message from the IoTDI 2016 program chairs",
    "abstract": "Welcome to the inaugural edition of the International IEEE Conference on Internet-of-Things (IoT) Design and Implementation! This conference is created to offer a premier publication venue that covers a broad spectrum of systems issues related to the emerging field of the Internet of Things. The desire to start a new conference in the field was born out of an observation that while many publication venues exist today on different aspects of IoT, they are generally either more specialized or more regional. There is room for a new top conference that brings together researchers in academia, industry, and government around the growing interdisciplinary challenges related to IoT. Indeed, there are established top conferences in fields such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Networked Sensing, Networking, Mobile Computing, and Cloud Computing, but IoT systems span across the boundaries of these disciplines. No single current venue exists today that offers such a multidisciplinary perspective, motivated explicitly by IoT systems research. For example, while some conferences cover sensing and CPS, they do not necessarily cover cloud-related issues, and while others are premier venues on cloud computing, they do not cover front-end challenges. Most current conferences that are labeled IoT also specialize in a subset of topics, such as security, enterprise, or industrial perspectives."
