    "title": "An Architecture for On-Demand Active Web Content Distribution",
    "abstract": "The phenomenal growth of the world-wide web has made it the most popular Internet application today. Web caching and content delivery services have been recognized as valuable techniques to mitigate the explosion of web traffic. An increasing fraction of web traffic today is dynamically generated and therefore uncacheable using present static approaches. Scalable delivery of such active content poses a myriad of challenges, including content replication, update propagation, and consistency management. This paper describes a scalable architecture for transparent demand-driven distribution of active content. Our approach involves migrating the scripts which generate the dynamic web traffic, and their data, from the server to an active content distribution proxy nearest to the client. Our architecture is extendible in that it can incorporate a variety of data consistency management policies to ensure that the client sees an up-to-date copy of the dynamically generated web page. We show that significant improvements are observed in effective throughput and client response time."
