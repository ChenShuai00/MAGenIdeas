    "title": "WELL: Applying Bug Detectors to Bug Localization via Weakly Supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "Bug localization, which is used to help programmers identify the location of bugs in source code, is an essential task in software development. Researchers have already made efforts to harness the powerful deep learning (DL) techniques to automate it. However, training bug localization model is usually challenging because it requires a large quantity of data labeled with the bug's exact location, which is difficult and time\u2010consuming to collect. By contrast, obtaining bug detection data with binary labels of whether there is a bug in the source code is much simpler. This paper proposes a WEakly supervised bug LocaLization (WELL) method, which only uses the bug detection data with binary labels to train a bug localization model. With CodeBERT finetuned on the buggy\u2010or\u2010not binary labeled data, WELL can address bug localization in a weakly supervised manner. The evaluations on three method\u2010level synthetic datasets and one file\u2010level real\u2010world dataset show that WELL is significantly better than the existing state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art model in typical bug localization tasks such as variable misuse and other bugs."
