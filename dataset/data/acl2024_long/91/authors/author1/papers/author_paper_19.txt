    "title": "PyTrial: A Comprehensive Platform for Artificial Intelligence for Drug Development",
    "abstract": "Drug development is a complex process that aims to test the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of candidate drugs in the human body for regulatory approval via clinical trials. Recently, machine learning has emerged as a vital tool for drug development, offering new opportunities to improve the ef\ufb01ciency and success rates of the process. To facilitate the research and development of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) for drug development, we develop a Python package, namely PyTrial , that implements various clinical trial tasks supported by AI algorithms. To be speci\ufb01c, PyTrial implements 6 essential drug development tasks, including patient outcome prediction, trial site selection, trial outcome prediction, patient-trial matching, trial similarity search, and synthetic data generation. In PyTrial , all tasks are de\ufb01ned by four steps: load data, model de\ufb01nition, model training, and model evaluation, which can be done with a couple of lines of code. In addition, the modular API design allows practitioners to extend the framework to new algorithms and tasks easily. PyTrial is featured for a uni\ufb01ed API, detailed documentation, and interactive examples with preprocessed benchmark data for all implemented algorithms. This package can be installed through Python Package Index (PyPI) and is publicly available at https://github.com/RyanWangZf/PyTrial ."
