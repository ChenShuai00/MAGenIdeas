    "title": "Uncertainty-guided Curriculum Learning via In\ufb01nitesimal Jackknife",
    "abstract": "A key challenge in curriculum learning (CL) is to de-sign reasonable metrics for scoring sample dif\ufb01culty. Current data-driven CL algorithms need to learn extra parameters for the sample scoring task. In contrast, we propose a novel approach, called uncertainty-guided curriculum learning (UGCL), where the sample dif\ufb01culty is scored according to both the uncertainty in model\u2019s decision-making (epistemic) and the uncertainty inherent in data (aleatoric). Besides, we show a novel scoring metric based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which combines the uncertainty and predicted probability of the target class (measuring the dif\ufb01culty for the model to make a correct prediction) together to evaluate sample dif\ufb01culty simultaneously. Moreover, in order to avoid burdensome learning on Bayesian neural network, we apply the in\ufb01nitesimal jackknife (IJ) to quantify uncertainty in model weights through a pseudo ensemble approach based on Fisher information matrix. Experiments on various image and text datasets empirically verify the superiority of UGCL over the state-of-the-art CL baselines. The source code of our algorithm is available in https://github.com/RyanWangZf/ Uncertainty-Curriculum-Learning."
