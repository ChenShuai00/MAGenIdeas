    "title": "GraphCare: Enhancing Healthcare Predictions with Open-World Personalized Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "Clinical predictive models often rely on patients\u2019 electronic health records (EHR), but integrating medical knowledge to enhance predictions and decision-making is challenging. This is because personalized predictions require personalized knowledge graphs (KGs), which are dif\ufb01cult to generate from patient EHR data. To address this, we propose GraphCare , an open-world framework that leverages external KGs to improve EHR-based predictions. Our method extracts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and external biomedical KGs to generate patient-speci\ufb01c KGs, which are then used to train our proposed Bi-attention Aug-menTed ( BAT ) graph neural network (GNN) for healthcare predictions. We evaluate GraphCare on two public datasets: MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV. Our method outperforms baseline models in four vital healthcare prediction tasks: mortality, readmission, length-of-stay, and drug recommendation, improving AUROC on MIMIC-III by average margins of 10.4%, 3.8%, 2.0%, and 1.5%, respectively. Notably, GraphCare demonstrates a substantial edge in scenarios with limited data availability. Our \ufb01ndings highlight the potential of using external KGs in health-care prediction tasks and demonstrate the promise of GraphCare in generating personalized KGs for promoting personalized medicine."
