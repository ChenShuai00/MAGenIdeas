    "title": "Mitigating Fine-Grained Hallucination by Fine-Tuning Large Vision-Language Models with Caption Rewrites",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. To comprehend and execute diverse human instructions over image data, instruction-tuned large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been introduced. However, LVLMs may suffer from different types of object hallucinations. Nevertheless, LVLMs are evaluated for coarse-grained object hallucinations only (i.e., generated objects non-existent in the input image). The fine-grained object attributes and behaviors non-existent in the image may still be generated but not measured by the current evaluation methods. In this paper, we thus focus on reducing fine-grained hallucinations of LVLMs. We propose \\textit{ReCaption}, a framework that consists of two components: rewriting captions using ChatGPT and fine-tuning the instruction-tuned LVLMs on the rewritten captions. We also propose a fine-grained probing-based evaluation method named \\textit{Fine-Grained Object Hallucination Evaluation} (\\textit{FGHE}). Our experiment results demonstrate that ReCaption effectively reduces fine-grained object hallucination for different LVLM options and improves their text generation quality.
