    "abstract": "A significant challenge in video understanding is posed by the high dimensionality of the input, which induces large computational cost and high memory footprints. Deep convolutional models operating on video apply pooling and striding to reduce feature dimensionality and to increase the receptive field. However, despite these strategies, modern approaches cannot effectively leverage spatiotemporal structure over long temporal extents. In this paper we introduce an approach that reduces a video of 10 seconds to a sparse graph of only 160 feature nodes such that efficient inference in this graph produces state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging action recognition datasets. The nodes of our graph are semantic supervoxels that capture the spatiotemporal structure of objects and motion cues in the video, while edges between nodes encode spatiotemporal relations and feature similarity. We demonstrate that a shallow network that interleaves graph convolution and graph pooling on this compact representation implements an effective mechanism of relational reasoning yielding strong recognition results on both Charades and Something-Something."
