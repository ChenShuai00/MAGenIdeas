    "title": "Improving video retrieval using multilingual knowledge transfer",
    "abstract": "Video retrieval has seen tremendous progress with the devel- opment of vision-language models. However, further improving these models require additional labelled data which is a huge manual effort. In this paper, we propose a framework MKTVR, that utilizes knowledge transfer from a multilin- gual model to boost the performance of video retrieval. We \ufb01rst use state-of-the-art machine translation models to con- struct pseudo ground-truth multilingual video-text pairs. We then use this data to learn a video-text representation where English and non-English text queries are represented in a common embedding space based on pretrained multilingual models. We evaluate our proposed approach on four English video retrieval datasets such as MSRVTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and Charades. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets out- performing previous models. Finally, we also evaluate our model on a multilingual video-retrieval dataset encompassing six languages and show that our model outperforms previous multilingual video retrieval models in a zero-shot setting. \u2191 , rank 10 (R@10) \u2191 , Median Rank (MdR) \u2193 and Mean Rank (MnR) \u2193 are reported. Results of other methods taken from mentioned references. Our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art performance. In video-to-text retrieval, our model achieved 1.6 points boost in performance."
