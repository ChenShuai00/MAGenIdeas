    "title": "Differential Privacy for Text Analytics via Natural Text Sanitization",
    "abstract": "Texts convey sophisticated knowledge. However, texts also convey sensitive information. Despite the success of general-purpose language models and domain-specific mechanisms with differential privacy (DP), existing text sanitization mechanisms still provide low utility, as cursed by the high-dimensional text representation. The companion issue of utilizing sanitized texts for downstream analytics is also under-explored. This paper takes a direct approach to text sanitization. Our insight is to consider both sensitivity and similarity via our new local DP notion. The sanitized texts also contribute to our sanitization-aware pretraining and fine-tuning, enabling privacy-preserving natural language processing over the BERT language model with promising utility. Surprisingly, the high utility does not boost up the success rate of inference attacks."
