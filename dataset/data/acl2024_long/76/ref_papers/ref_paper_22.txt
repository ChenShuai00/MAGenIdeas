    "title": "SSSE: Efficiently Erasing Samples from Trained Machine Learning Models",
    "abstract": "The availability of large amounts of user-provided data has been key to the success of machine learning for many real-world tasks. Recently, an increasing awareness has emerged that users should be given more control about how their data is used. In particular, users should have the right to prohibit the use of their data for training machine learning systems, and to have it erased from already trained systems. While several sample erasure methods have been proposed, all of them have drawbacks which have prevented them from gaining widespread adoption. Most methods are either only applicable to very specific families of models, sacrifice too much of the original model's accuracy, or they have prohibitive memory or computational requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective algorithm, SSSE, for samples erasure, that is applicable to a wide class of machine learning models. From a second-order analysis of the model's loss landscape we derive a closed-form update step of the model parameters that only requires access to the data to be erased, not to the original training set. Experiments on three datasets, CelebFaces attributes (CelebA), Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) and CIFAR10, show that in certain cases SSSE can erase samples almost as well as the optimal, yet impractical, gold standard of training a new model from scratch with only the permitted data."
