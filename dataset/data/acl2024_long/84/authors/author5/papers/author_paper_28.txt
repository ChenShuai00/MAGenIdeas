    "title": "Simultaneous Machine Translation with Visual Context",
    "abstract": "Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) is a branch of Natural Language Processing which tries to solve the task of translating streams of text from one source language to another target language in real-time. This is indeed different from the traditional machine translation system where the translator has the luxury of having complete information about a source text. Simultaneous Machine Translator, on the other hand has to make a decision at every time step, choosing either to get more context from the source or generate output prediction for the target. This incurs an interesting tradeoff between translation quality and latency, since waiting for more context from the source will potentially improve translation accuracy while incurring more waiting time. Recent works show that by incorporating visual information from images related to a source text, one is able to improve the translation quality of a plain SiMT system. This however, introduces extra latency from extracting image features, and combining both visual and linguistic context. Keeping these considerations in mind, the challenge for us is to build a SiMT system with visual context which has a fine balance between high quality and low latency. Finally, the aim of our project is to build a user interface that relies on a simultaneous machine translation model to provide a real-time translation service."
