    "abstract": "Given the advanced set of capabilities offered by smartphone and tablet computing devices, they have become the platform of choice for many users for day-to-day work and leisure. There is however a fundamental difference in the attitude of a typical user when it comes to using their mobile device as compared to their personal computers. While the use of anti-virus software on PCs to protect our security and privacy is ubiquitous today, there is little by the way of security and privacy protection available on these mobile computing platforms. Our work focuses on developing a Layered Intrusion Detection and Remediation framework (LIDAR) to automatically detect, analyze, protect, and remediate security threats in this domain. We have focused on Android devices and have developed several algorithms that would help detect abnormal behavior in the operation of Android smartphone and tablets that could potentially detect presence of malware. In this paper, we present a high-level overview of our approach and briefly summarize a suite of algorithms developed to identify certain types of malicious behavior."
