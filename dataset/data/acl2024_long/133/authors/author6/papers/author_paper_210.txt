    "abstract": "Abstract : This is the final report for the ARO Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) project entitled Information Assurance for Energy-Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks. A summary of the project outcomes is as follows. Six PhD students were fully or partially funded at the Network Security Lab (NSL), University of Washington: Mingyan Li (2006 At Boeing R&D), Loukas Lazos (2006, Assistant Professor at University of Arizona, received NSF CAREER Award in 2009), Krishna Sampigethaya (2007, Boeing R&D), Patrick Tague(2009, Assistant Professor at Carnegie-Mellon University - Mountain View), Weiyao Lin (2010, Assistant Professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University), Basel Alomair (2011, Assistant Professor at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology), and Sidharth Nabar (2011, Microsoft). During this performance period, graduate students of NSL received multiple best paper awards in IEEE Conferences, one IEEE William C. Carter award for dissertation contribution, Two EE Department Outstanding Research Awards, One NSA Center for Excellence Outstanding Research Award, joint patent filings with Boeing Company as well Army Research Laboratory members. In addition, the PECASE research also led to collaborations with DoD researchers and presentations at the Protocol Exchange meetings of NSA held at Naval Postgraduate School."
