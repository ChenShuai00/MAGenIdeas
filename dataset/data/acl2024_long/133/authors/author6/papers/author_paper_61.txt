    "title": "Design of Nano Thermoelectric Generator for Wireless Nano-Sensor Network",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a nano vitality collector dependent on temperature angle utilizing thermoelectric materials. A thermoelectric generator (TEG) produces electrical vitality from temperature contrast. Right now, the gadget is planned to fit as a fiddle for the simplicity of creation.nanoscale gadgets render assortment of ar WNSNs include nanosensors that are familiar with Nano The thermoelectric generator is a wellspring of a sustainable power source. It can change over warmth vitality to electrical vitality utilizing the Seebeck coefficient of the materials. There has been a quick headway in microelectronics which has made the nanotechnology huge and it has prodded the development of remote correspondence. For an occasion, nanosensors can distinguish any concoction organization in fixations as low as one section for every billion In this manner, in thought to the one of a kind qualities of nanosensors, it is impractical and infeasible to fuse any extra circuit in the equipment of nanosensors. Such a working situation of nanosensors gadgets makes an objective of vitality safeguarding because of constrained design battery assets inserted into it. transceiver and nanoantenna working at the Terahertz recurrence band (0.1-10THz). Up until now, analysts have concentrated on vitality productivity in WSNs however the vitality issue in WNSNs has not been tended to fundamentally in the current writing. The reenactment examination is acted in MATLAB Software to experimentally research the exhibition of proposed vitality adjusted bunching consolidating the proper ClusterHead (CH) determination. The fundamental extent of this structured gadget is to give the capacity to remote, biomedical and IoT sensors which devour less vitality to work. Reenactment of this examinationworkhasbeendone in COMSOL Multiphysics."
