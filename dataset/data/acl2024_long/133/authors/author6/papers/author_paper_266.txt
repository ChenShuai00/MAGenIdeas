    "title": "MULTI-DOMAIN RFID ACCESS CONTROL USING ASYMMETRIC KEY BASED TAG-READER MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION",
    "abstract": "Multi-domain RFID applications, such as asset tracking across domains, shift the paradigm in business model and enable next-generation business processes for aviation industry. The increasing number of RFID applications also merits the consolidation of RFID tags so they can serve multiple purposes. However, the adoption of such multi-domain RFID applications depends on their ability to enforce access control to the tags that will be accessed by different stakeholders across multiple domains. In this paper, we address multi-domain RFID access control. We evaluate existing solutions in the literature and identify their limitations. We propose using asymmetric key based tag-reader mutual authentication to grant only the authorized read/write access to tags. Challenges in deploying such an asymmetrickey based approach are identified, and solutions to one salient challenge, certificate management in resource-constrained RFID, are presented. Finally, we present a server-based access control scheme for multi-domain RFID systems and perform security analysis.."
