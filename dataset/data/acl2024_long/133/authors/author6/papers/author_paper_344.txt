    "title": "Security Analysis of a Distributed Common Secret Generation Procedure",
    "abstract": "In [1, 2], a distributed scheme allowing any number of members to compute a common secret without revealing individual secret was proposed. We present a security weakness of this protocol. In doing so, we show that any two members can collude and obtain the secret contributed by middle member in generating the common secret."
