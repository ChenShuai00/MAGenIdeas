    "title": "Impact of Public Key Enabled Applications on the Operation and Maintenance of Commercial Airplanes",
    "abstract": "Making airplanes network-enabled can significantly increase the efficiency of aircraft manufacturing, operation and maintenance processes. Yet these benefits cannot be realized without addressing the potential for network-induced security threats. This paper addresses challenges that emerge for network-enabled airplanes that use public key cryptography-based applications. In particular, we focus on the electronic distribution of airplane software and data. We present both an ad hoc approach, without trust chains between certificates, and a structured approach employing a PKI. Both approaches facilitate public key-enabled applications, and both levy operational requirements on airlines. We describe the integration of these requirements into existing airline ground infrastructure and processes, to minimize operating overhead. The presented work is based on ongoing collaborative efforts among Boeing, FAA and EASA, to identify needs of the airlines for operating and maintaining network-enabled airplanes."
