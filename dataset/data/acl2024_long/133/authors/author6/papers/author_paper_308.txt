    "title": "Information assurance in manets and wireless sensor networks",
    "abstract": "Manets and sensor networks are two classes of the wireless ad hoc networks with resource constraints. Manets typically consist of devices that have high capabilities, mobile and operate in coalitions. Sensor networks are typically deployed in specific geographical regions for monitoring and sensing. Both these wireless networks are characterized by their ad hoc nature that lack pre deployed infrastructure for computing and communication. Resource constraints, medium pathloss, and signal interference limit the communication range between any tow nodes, leading to the need for a multihop communication network. Such a network must be collaboratively formed and supported by the resource constraint nodes. For meaningful service provision, such a network must be able to provide confidentiality, integrity, and entity verification among participating nodes. In this talk, we will focus on such networks and discuss the challenges ahead that require fresh approaches in trust establishment and secure network service operations. We will take secure location services, probabilistic pre key deployment strategies, and group mobility scenarios of VANETs as examples to demonstrate the challenges in trust establishment and providing privacy."
