    "title": "Public key based authentication for secure integration of sensor data and RFID",
    "abstract": "The incorporation of sensor readings into RFID tags creates a significant potential for applications which require environment monitoring as well as asset management and tracking, such as blood storage and management, and on-board aircraft part maintenance. On one hand, the environment history is essential in evaluating health and integrity of objects to be protected, such as blood and aircraft part. On the other hand, the periodic sensing information stored in RFID enables identifying the events of displacing and removal of the objects. However, the benefits of integrating RFID with sensor data are achieved only when the authenticity and integrity of data written to and stored at RFID are ensured. In this paper, we present challenges on secure integration of sensor readings and RFID, and compare security solutions of data integrity and authenticity for resource-constrained RFID tags. For mutual authentication between RFID tags and sensors (or readers), the public key based approaches proves efficient and feasible. We further evaluate different public key based approaches in terms of storage and communication efficiency."
