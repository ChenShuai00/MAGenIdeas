    "title": "Secure Broadcast in Energy-Aware Wireless Sensor Networks",
    "abstract": "Abstract : This paper considers the problem of securing multicast communications in an energy-constrained ad-hoc network environment. The authors show that existing efficient key distribution techniques for wired networks that rely on logical hierarchies are extremely energy inefficient for energy-constrained wireless ad-hoc networks. They also show that the joint consideration of routing and physical layer algorithms is critical for developing energy-efficient key distribution. They formulate the correct problem and show that the solution is hard to compute, and then present a greedy, routing-aware key-distribution algorithm that is easy to compute*."
