    "title": "SeRLoc: Robust localization for wireless sensor networks",
    "abstract": "Many distributed monitoring applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) require the location information of a sensor node. In this article, we address the problem of enabling nodes of Wireless Sensor Networks to determine their location in an untrusted environment, known as the secure localization problem. We propose a novel range-independent localization algorithm called SeRLoc that is well suited to a resource constrained environment such as a WSN. SeRLoc is a distributed algorithm based on a two-tier network architecture that allows sensors to passively determine their location without interacting with other sensors. We show that SeRLoc is robust against known attacks on a WSNs such as the wormhole attack, the Sybil attack, and compromise of network entities and analytically compute the probability of success for each attack. We also compare the performance of SeRLoc with state-of-the-art range-independent localization schemes and show that SeRLoc has better performance."
