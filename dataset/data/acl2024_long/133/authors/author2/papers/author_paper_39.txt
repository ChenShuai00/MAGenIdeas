    "title": "Control Barrier Functions for Abstraction-Free Control Synthesis under Temporal Logic Constraints",
    "abstract": "Temporal logic has been widely used to express complex task specifications for cyber-physical systems (CPSs). One way to synthesize a controller for CPS under temporal logic constraints is to first abstract the CPS as a discrete transition system, and then apply formal methods. This approach, however, is computationally demanding and its scalability suffers due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a control barrier function (CBF) approach to abstraction-free control synthesis under a linear temporal logic (LTL) constraint. We first construct the deterministic Rabin automaton of the specification and compute an accepting run. We then compute a sequence of LTL formulae, each of which must be satisfied during a particular time interval, and prove that satisfying the sequence of formulae is sufficient to satisfy the LTL specification. Finally, we compute a control policy for satisfying each formula by constructing an appropriate CBF. We present a quadratic program to compute the controllers, and show the controllers synthesized using the proposed approach guarantees the system to satisfy the LTL specification, provided the quadratic program is feasible at each time step. A numerical case study is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach."
