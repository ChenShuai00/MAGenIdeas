    "title": "Risk-Aware Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Autonomous cyber and cyber-physical systems need to perform decision-making, learning, and control in unknown environments. Such decision-making can be sensitive to multiple factors, including modeling errors, changes in costs, and impacts of events in the tails of probability distributions. Although multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides a framework for learning behaviors through repeated interactions with the environment by minimizing an average cost, it is not adequate to overcome the above challenges. In this paper, we develop a distributed MARL approach to solve decision-making problems in unknown environments by learning risk-aware actions. We use the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to define the cost function that is being minimized, and introduce a Bellman operator to characterize the value function associated to a given state-action pair. We prove that this operator satisfies a contraction property, and that it converges to the optimal value function. We then propose a distributed MARL algorithm called the CVaR QD-Learning algorithm, and establish that value functions of individual agents reach consensus. We identify several challenges that arise in the implementation of the CVaR QD-Learning algorithm, and present solutions to overcome these. We evaluate the CVaR QD-Learning algorithm through simulations, and demonstrate the effect of a risk parameter on value functions at consensus."
