    "title": "Open Domain Question Answering over Virtual Documents: A Unified Approach for Data and Text",
    "abstract": "Due to its potential for a universal interface 001 over both data and text, data-to-text genera-002 tion is becoming increasingly popular. How-003 ever, few prior work has focused on its ap-004 plication to downstream tasks, e.g. using the 005 converted data for grounding or reasoning. 006 In this work, we bridge this gap and use 007 the data-to-text method as a means for en-008 coding structured knowledge for knowledge-009 intensive applications, i.e. open-domain ques-010 tion answering (ODQA). Speci\ufb01cally, we pro-011 pose a verbalizer-retriever-reader framework 012 for ODQA over data and text where verbal-013 ized tables from Wikipedia and graphs from 014 Wikidata are used as augmented knowledge 015 sources. We show that our U ni\ufb01ed D ata and 016 T ext QA , UDT-QA , can effectively bene\ufb01t 017 from the expanded knowledge index, leading 018 to large gains over text-only baselines. No-019 tably, our approach sets the single-model state-020 of-the-art on Natural Questions. Furthermore, 021 our analyses indicate that verbalized knowl-022 edge is preferred for answer reasoning for both 023 adapted and hot-swap settings. 024"
