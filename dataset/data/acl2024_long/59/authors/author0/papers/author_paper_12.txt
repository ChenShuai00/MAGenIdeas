    "title": "Panoramic-Encoder: A Fast and Accurate Response Selection Paradigm for Generation-Based Dialogue Systems",
    "abstract": "Response selector is an essential component of generation-based dialogue systems and it aims to pick out an optimal response in a candidate pool to continue the dialogue. The current state-of-the-art methods are mainly based on the encoding paradigm called Cross-Encoder (Urbanek et al., 2019), which separately encodes each context-response pair and ranks the responses according to their \ufb01tness scores. However, Cross-Encoder repeatedly encodes the same lengthy context for each response, resulting in high computational costs. Moreover, without considering the relationship among the candidates, it is dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01g-ure out which candidate is the best response purely based on the \ufb01tness score per candidate. We aim to address these problems through a new paradigm called Panoramic-Encoder . The proposed method encodes all candidates and the context at once and realizes the mutual interaction using a tailored candidate attention mechanism (CAM). It also enables the integration of some effective training techniques, such as the in-batch negative training, which cannot be used in Cross-Encoders . Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets show that our new method signi\ufb01cantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art with lower computational complexity."
