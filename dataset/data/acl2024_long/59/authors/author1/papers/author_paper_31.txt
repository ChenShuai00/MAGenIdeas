    "title": "Chinese Deterministic Dependency Parser Considering Prepositional Phrase",
    "abstract": "It's proved that Nivre\u2019s algorithm causes some errors for determining the right-side dependents. In Chinese, only verbs and prepositions have right-side dependents. Jin proposed a two-phase parser to solve verbs' problems. In this paper, we present a method to solve prepositions 'problems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves higher accuracy than previous approach."
