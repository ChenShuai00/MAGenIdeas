# Enhancing Research Idea Generation through Combinatorial Innovation and Multi-Agent Iterative Search Strategies

##  :key: Introduction

This repository contains the code for our paper "Enhancing Research Idea Generation through Combinatorial Innovation and Multi-Agent Iterative Search Strategies" which had been accepted by [20th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENTOMETRICS & INFORMETRICS](https://issi2025.iiap.sci.am/).

- We propose a multi-agent iterative search strategy (multi-domain knowledge fusion + multi-agent discussion) to enhance the performance of large language models in generating scientific research methodologies, while utilizing real-world data for role-playing and conducting objective evaluation of the final outputs.
- We evaluated the strategy based on the novelty and diversity of the generated scientific research ideas. The results demonstrate that the multi-agent iterative search strategy improves output quality, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.



## üõ†Ô∏è Environment

We recommend using Python version 3.10 or higher.

```bash
cd agentscope-main
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## :books: Dataset

The raw data is based on the [Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2024) - ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/events/acl-2024/#2024acl-long)

After preprocessing, the used data is publicly available at ./dataset/data/acl2024_long


## üìÅ Code Structure
Here we explain the roles of several critical files:

- `main/idea_generator.py` - Core implementation of the research idea generation system
- `agentscope-main/src/agentscope/agents/sci_agent.py` - Defines the customized scientist agents, inspired by https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09403v2
- `utils/prompt.py` - Contains all prompts used by the agents
- `utils/scientist_utils.py` - Common utility functions

## üöÄ Usage
### API Configuration
Configure your DeepSeek API key in the environment variables:
```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

### Running the System
After setting up the models, run:
```bash
cd main/idea_generator.py
python python idea_generator.py
```

Common arguments:
- `--idea_ids`: List of idea IDs to process (default [0])
- `--paper_idxs`: List of paper indexes to process (required)
- `--group_max_iteration`: Max discussion iterations (default 3)
- `--num_processes`: Number of parallel processes (default 15)

## üìä Results
Output files are saved in `virtual_scientists/results/`:
